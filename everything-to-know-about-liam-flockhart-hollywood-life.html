However, his parents have spoken about him publicly on occasion, giving fans a hint of what Liam is like as a person. According to his dad, he’s quite the adrenaline junkie.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>During a 2019 interview with<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>, Harrison revealed he and Liam went skydiving “probably because Liam said he wanted to do it.” He then admitted they were thinking about going again, but with one catch: They didn’t plan on mentioning it to Calista!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Liam has certainly enriched Harrison’s life, which he explained during a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parade</a>. “I wasn’t expecting [to adopt] at all,” he admitted. “The unexpected part was certainly true and the joy is also true. I think Liam was about 6 or 8 months old when I met him and Calista. We have been together ever since.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Harrison-Ford-Calista-Flockhart-Liam-younger-spl-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Indiana Jones</a> star also gave a glimpse into what being a dad to a young kid was like in his household. “On the weekends, I do whatever Calista and Liam want to do. We’ll take a couple of hours on Sunday morning to go motorcycle riding or go for a hike,” he explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Harrison also once admitted that his older kids taught him how to be a pro parent, making it a breeze when Liam came along. “I’ve got five kids in total, so it’s not my first rodeo. … My older children have taught me a lot about parenting. My first child was born when I was 25. I reckon I’m a little better at it now,” he noted in a 2010 interview with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Independent</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Meanwhile, Calista has kept fairly tight-lipped about Liam over the years but did express her gratitude for being able to adopt him in 2001. “I have always wanted to adopt a child and I am overjoyed that I have been blessed with a beautiful and healthy son,” she said in a statement at the time, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News</a>. “I’m completely enchanted and awe-struck.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Kao6KrpJZ6p7jOnKKhmaKperS7zWZsamhpaYFxew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
