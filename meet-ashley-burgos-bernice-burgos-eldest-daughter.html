The celebrity daughter was born by her mother Bernice Burgos and her boyfriend whose identity has remained undisclosed to this day. Sadly, Ashley only got to grow up with her mother, as her father who perhaps was not yet ready for fatherhood absconded just after she was born.</p><p>For her basic education, Ashley attended Hampstead High School. However, there is no information on whether or not she took her education any further than that.</p><h3><strong>How Old was Ashley Burgos’s Mother When She Had Her?</strong></h3><p>Bernie Burgos was only 15 years old when she had her eldest daughter, Ashley, while her then-boyfriend who was Ashley’s father was just 19 years old. Right after her birth, Ashley’s father felt incapable of being a father at such a young age and made a run for it, leaving Bernice all alone to take care of herself and their young daughter.</p><p>After this, Bernie’s mom; Ashley’s grandmother kicked her out of the house and she was forced to go live with her boyfriend’s mom while trying to juggle schoolwork and pregnancy. However, this was too big a task for a 15-year-old girl, and she was forced to drop out after she only managed to graduate from high school.</p><p>Left with no choice but to face her responsibilities as a young teen mom, Bernie was forced to take up a job as a waitress in a bar. Before long, her outgoing personality and smoking-hot body drew her to the attention of some music producers and photographers eager to cast her in their music videos. Her modeling career kick-started soon after that when she made her first music video appearance in Jay Cole’s song, “Working Out”.</p><h2><strong>What Does Bernice Burgos’ Daughter Ashley, Do For A Living?</strong></h2><p>Given that she grew up watching her mother achieve fame and prestige in the American fashion industry, the celebrity daughter has grown to be a young woman just as ambitious and successful as her mother. At 24 years old, Ashley has successfully created a name for herself in the fashion industry as both a model and co-founder of a reputable clothing line. Below is a detailed summary of her career journey so far.</p><h3><strong>Ashley Burgos’ is also a Model like Her Mom</strong></h3><p>Because she grew up watching her mother work her way up the ladder as a model, it comes as no surprise that Ashley Burgos chose to do the same thing that her superstar model mom, Bernice Burgos is known for.</p><p>Although a part of her success story can be credited to her mother’s influence, Ashley is a phenomenal model in her right and she has earned her flowers as a leading model and fashion inspiration in the American fashion industry.</p><p>Ashley’s career as a model started in 2017 when she was 18 years old. She started by posting several steamy pictures of herself on her Instagram handle, and soon enough, many popular brands showed interest in working with her. Over the years, her Instagram handle, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@realashleyburgos</a> has grown into a big community with a healthy number of over 200K followers who are attracted by her unique content.</p><h3><strong>She is a Musician</strong></h3><p>While trying to follow in her mom’s footsteps, the young Instagram star has dared to be different from her by venturing into the music industry. In December 2022, she announced the release of her new single, “Back On the Market”. She was also on the remix of the music video titled <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">“Gorgeous”</a>. The track featured Ashley with rappers like Skilla Baby and Tee Grizzley.</p><h3><strong>She is also an Entrepreneur with a Clothing Line</strong></h3><p>Like her mother Bernie, Ashley has good fashion taste, and together, the duo has worked to turn their passion into a profitable business. Ashley and Bernice Burgos are co-founders of <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bold and Beautiful</a>. Founded in 2017, Bold and Beautiful is a women’s clothing line offering women a variety of comfortable, yet sexy sleep and loungewear. Since its creation, the fashion line has continued to grow even bigger and promises to reach greater heights under the leadership of the mother-daughter duo.</p><h2><strong>Does Ashley Burgos Have a Child?</strong></h2><p>Ashley Burgos is the mother of a beautiful little girl. Her daughter, India Ava Burgos was born in February 2018 and is currently 5 years old. At the time of her daughter’s birth in 2018, Ashley was a twenty-two-year-old adult woman. Therefore, she was at least seven years older than her mum’s age of fifteen when she was born to her.</p><p>Although her fear of criticism from her fans made her hide her daughter’s identity initially, the top-rank model has long embraced her role as a mother and is super proud of her daughter whom she has opened an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a>. Little India is a very pretty little girl who promises to be a superstar in her right, just like her mom and grandma.</p><h2><strong>Who is Ashley Burgos’ Baby Daddy?</strong></h2><p>Ashley welcomed her daughter India with her boyfriend, Sambou Bubba Camara. Bubba is a Gambian businessman and CEO of the HBTL music label. With a knack for keeping her private affairs private, Ashley prefers to keep the identities of the men in her life a secret and would have done so too with Bubba, had it not been for their daughter’s arrival.</p><p>Regardless, India’s parents are very proud of her and are very committed to raising her together. This is evident in how frequently they upload lovely pictures of her on their Instagram accounts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC5xJ6rZpmjnbmmxYybrKufn6h6o7HRp6CcnV2XwrOzzqxknqSUmsC1ecOarKCgpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
