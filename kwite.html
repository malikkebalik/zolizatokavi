It is unknown why he prefers to keep his face hidden from his fans. However, FPSDiesel, a fellow YouTuber and his friend, suggested that it could be due to his acne. However, he has not confirmed or denied this statement. As a result, we don’t know whether this is true or not.</p><p>There was also a rumor that he didn’t have legs. And the legs that viewers and fans see are actually prosthetics. However, he proved them all wrong by posting pictures of his real legs, which were not prosthetics, on social media. Furthermore, he doesn’t even show his face to any of his fans, so being secretive about his love life is natural for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kwite-2-300x169.jpg><h2>Body Dimensions of Kwite</h2><p>Kwite’s body measurements, such as height, weight, chest size, waist size, hip size, and many other sizes, are not currently available.
