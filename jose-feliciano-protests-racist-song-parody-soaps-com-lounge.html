Obviously not before hundreds or thousands of people heard their parady. For Shame!</p><p>I read about this the other day…it made me rather mad due to the fact that my fiance is mexican and our Cruz is as well…some people are a disgrace and disgust me. ~) ~)</p><p>Some day probably not in our lifetime, but this racism will end!!! I am a believer in that. I just wish we didn't have to wait. Our younger generation will over come the hate. I think the dj's should have been canned. I am sure their ratings have dropped. Way to go Jose!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Latina.com</a> has an article on this disgusting song and there is an audio of the song with the lyrics:</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.latina.com/lifestyle/news-politics/listen-illegals-my-yard-parody-jose-felicianos-feliz-navidad</a></p><p>This is beyond sick!</p><p>i will not even listen to it and i do think they should be fired, reminds me of limbaugh</p><p>Some people have nothing better to do with their time I guess. My radio station always does spoofs who cares it's funny!! i mean does anyone remember back when Weird All used to butcher songs! Snl makes fun of stuff all the time who cares!!</p><p>People have been spoofing songs forever bottom line imo who cares!! It's just words. My kids sing a version of this song to it goes like this chaurice makes me fart, Chaurice makes me fart, ya I like chaurice cause it makes me fart. it's gross but hey it could be worse!!</p><p>I am white from a VERY white-bread world & I have always loved this song… in fact it is one of the few songs that I will hum or sing along to. I never gave it a thought all these years that it was anything but about 2 cultures coming together at Christmas!!</p><p>Some people are just plain trouble-makers!!</p><p>I don't know why it's so hard for some to admit or understand that that racist song was not a light hearted parody—plainly stated, it was racist. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about that. This isn't a Weird Al Yankovic redo of a MJ, Madonna, or Coolio song, either.</p><p>Quote <strong>OspreyGirl</strong>: I don't know why it's so hard for some to admit or understand that that racist song was not a light hearted parody---plainly stated, it was racist.

I would love to see their true love celebrated in a special wedding ! Do you agree? :))</p><p>Quote <strong>lovelyinlavendar</strong>: Wouldn't it be a wonderful show to anticipate and watch - -I wonder what Mrs. C. would wear - -and of course, what Amber would wear and Niki and Pearl. I would love to see their true love celebrated in a special wedding ! Do you agree? :))</p><p>I totally agree. It would be delightful, classy and eloquent, and Murphy would be the most handsome charming man.</p><p>I’ve been hoping for a wedding for these two for months! I think Murphy would look good in a black tuxedo and Katherine should wear something blue. Blue always brings out her lovely eyes! I just watched the movie “Grumpy Old Men.” Have any of you seen it? Jack Lemmon and Ann-Margret reminded me so much of Kay and Murph! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png title=:slight_smile: alt=:slight_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I love them both and want them to end up together…BUT, I don’t want them to get married. It might ruin it for me. IMO, I think it would provide ammunition to make Murphy into a bad guy. I don’t think most people want to see a dark side of him. If they aren’t married, they might not have as much to hide from each other…at least that is how it usually goes in “soap world”. Once the marriage happens, the demons sneak out.</p><p>I think it would be a lot of fun! Reception at Crimson Lights and honeymoon at the Athletic Club!</p><p>I really hope they keep Murphy around. Love the friendship and romance him and Kay have. So refreshing lately with all the sleeping around. How many true friends does Kay really have? Give my favorite actress on Y/R a break and let her have alittle happiness for atleast awhile.</p><p>Quote <strong>Old and tired</strong>: I really hope they keep Murphy around.

And Lauren could give Pearl a great outfit to wear !</p><p>Well okay for the spoiiler, Marty is leaving! Yes! -does a happy dance-</p><p>Rant: Up until yesterday I disagreed with what people said about the Ford brothers and now I only disagree when it comes to James and Nate. Ford you SOB! You stupid, dumba-- S.O.B go play in traffic and get ran over five times!</p><p>Can anyone believe he just did? Can anyone believe it at all? I am ticked off at bother him and Jessica. Him the most and Jessica for being the weaka-- mother she is. Wow, wow reaility is so much of a shock to you that you have to hide behind your little slutty alter.
