You had to work for years before joining the league of elite rich. But, with the advent of IT age, it became a bit easier to get rich at an early age. And, the recent apps boom has made it possible to go from rags to billions within the shortest time possible.</p><p>Of course, all the individuals featured on this list don’t belong solely to the tech field. The field of work of individuals listed in the article includes automotive, chemicals, show business and fashion. Without any further delay, let’s take a look at some of the richest and youngest personalities in the world right now.</p><p>(Please note: The list is sorted according to the age of individuals. The list will start with the youngest and will move in the ascending order, even if any successor has less wealth than its predecessor.)</p><li><h3><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Evan Spiegel</strong></a></h3></li><p><strong>Age</strong>: 25</p><p><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $2.1 billion</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal></a></p><p>Evan Spiegel, at the age of 25 has everything. He is a multi-billionaire, has a gorgeous Spanish Mansion in Los Angeles and even better, he is dating super hot supermodel <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Miranda Kerr</a>. He himself has acknowledged that he has everything. Spiegel started his rise in 2011 by co-founding Snapchat, the temporary photo messaging company with&nbsp;Bobby&nbsp;Murphy. Currently, he is the CEO of the company that was valued at $15 billion as of March 2015. As a son of a lawyer, he had a comfortable upbringing. He studied product design at Stanford University and met Murphy, who was two years ahead of him and studying math, at the Kappa Sigma frat house. The two initially developed an app called Picaboo. Using the app, you could send photo messages to contacts with a timer that would remove them in 10 seconds or less. The app flopped spectacularly.</p><p>They rebranded the app as Snapchat and it took off in fall 2011. It is currently used by more than 100 million people daily and about 65% of the users create content on Snapchat every day. He recently turned down an acquisition attempt by Facebook and has about 15 percent stake in the company. Spiegel believes that trading a pleasure of building an exciting business for a short-term gain isn’t very interesting.</p><li><h3><strong>Bobby Murphy</strong></h3></li><p><strong>Age</strong>: 27</p><p><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $1.8 billion</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal></a></p><p>According to Forbes, Bobby Murphy, who is the son of California state employees, one of whom emigrated from the Philippines also has at least 15 percent stake in the popular pictorial messaging app, Snapchat. He grew up in Berkeley, CA and is a 2-year senior of Evan and studied mathematics and computational science. Compared to Spiegel’s brash personality, Murphy has a placid demeanor and prefers to remain in the background, while his confident friend takes a more prominent role. His humble and frank nature was well evident when he gave an interview to the Forbes magazine. He claimed that he and Spiegel weren’t cool, so they tried to build things to be cool. And, no one can say that their brainchild Snapchat isn’t cool. According to the reports, the company had received new funding offers at an eye-popping valuation of $19 billion. And, as the company is in the early stages of product lifecycle, it will only grow in the coming years.</p><li><h3><strong>Julio Mario Santo Domingo III</strong></h3></li><p><strong>Age</strong>: 30</p><p><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $2.1 billion</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal></a></p><p>Julio Mario Santo Domingo III is probably the luckiest guy in this list. Whereas, most of the individuals in this list have earned their fortunes, Santo Domingo III has inherited from his rich grandpa. He is a New York City disc jockey and lives in a lavish $4 million apartment in New York City. He is one of four heirs to his namesake grandfather’s Colombian beer fortune. Julio Mario Santo Domingo, who died in 2011, owned Bavaria Brewery. But, in 2005, he sold the company for 15% stakes of SABMiller. According to the reports, Santo Domingo left one-sixth of his fortune to his grandson. He also has received great inheritance from his father Julio Mario Santo Domingo II who was once an investment advisor, but retired young to focus on gathering unusual artifacts.</p><p>Now, although the inheritance received from his father won’t amount too much, but it will surely make him look cool in front of his friends. The inheritance includes the world’s largest collection of opium pipes, along with 50,000 books, posters, photographs and other memorabilia documenting psychoactive drugs and their effects on people and society. However, the collection is currently on a long-term loan to Harvard University.</p><li><h3><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong></a></h3></li><p><strong>Age</strong>: 31</p><p><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $41.4 billion</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal></a></p><p>Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s wealth has reached new heights. Currently, with a net worth of $41.2 billion, he is the 8th <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>richest person in the world</a>.

Recently, the organization announced a $25 million grant to GiveDirectly, which gives cash to the very poor in East Africa. Moskovitz, who is a member of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bill Gates</a>‘s and Warren Buffett’s Giving Pledge is known for his humble and down to earth lifestyle.

It has come a long way from the company that was founded by Kathrein’s grandfather in a cellar in Rosenheim, Germany, shortly after World War I. Anton became CEO of the company in 2012 at the age of 28, when his father who had ran the company from 1972 died unexpectedly.</p><li><h3><strong>Elizabeth Holmes</strong></h3></li><p><strong>Age</strong>: 31</p><p><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $4.5 billion</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal></a></p><p>This year Elizabeth Holmes made her debut in the Billionaires list as the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>youngest self-made woman billionaire</a>. Her uncle’s death from cancer spurred her to develop a way to detect diseases earlier. In 2003, she dropped out of her sophomore year at&nbsp;Stanford University to establish blood testing company, Theranos with money she saved for college. She has pioneered the blood testing industry with cheaper, easier-to-use blood tests. Her labs require only a virtually painless prick of the finger and a few drops of blood to run several different tests at a fraction of the price of commercial labs. The 2014 was particularly a great year for Holmes and her company raised $400 million&nbsp;from venture capitalists. Theranos is currently valued at $9 billion, and Holmes’s with 50% stake at $4.5 billion. And, company’s deal with Walgreens, the largest U.S. retail pharmacy chain, with more than 8,100 stores, to roll out Theranos Wellness Centers inside Walgreens pharmacies has already kicked in. It seems the only way for Holmes is upwards.</p><li><h3><strong>Tatiana Casiraghi</strong></h3></li><p><strong>Age</strong>: 31</p><p><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $2.1 billion</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal></a></p><p>In 2013, after marrying Andrea Casiraghi, who is reportedly second in line to the throne, Tatiana Casiraghi became member of Monaco’s royal family.
