As a result of its popularity, the “Twilight” series were adapted into the film series known as “The Twilight Saga”, in which the main characters are portrayed by <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a>, <a href=#>Taylor Lautner</a> and <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>. The first film in the series succeeded at grossing over $389 million at the box office, while its latest installment entitled “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Down – Part 2” earned $829 million worldwide. The success of “Twilight” made Meyer one of “The 100 Most Influential People in 2008”.</p><h3>Stephenie Meyer Net Worth $125 Million</h3><p>A well-known author, how rich is Stephenie Meyer? According to sources, in 2011 she earned $21 million, while in 2012 her earnings amounted to $14 million. In regards to her overall wealth, Stephenie Meyer’s net worth is estimated to be $125 million, most of which she has earned from the sales of her popular novels.</p><p>Stephenie Meyer was born in 1973 in Connecticut, United States, yet she spent most of her childhood in Arizona, where she studied at the Chaparral High School. Meyer continued her studies at Brigham Young University, from which she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English language. Since Meyer felt she couldn’t fulfill her dream of becoming a writer, she decided upon going to law school. However, after the birth of her son, Stephenie Meyer was determined to focus on a writing career. Her first attempt, “Twilight” turned out to be a huge mainstream success, which earned a devoted fan base. Meyer’s series was translated into 37 languages, becoming popular not only in the United States, but abroad as well. Following the success of “Twilight”, in 2008 Stephenie Meyer came out with a sci-fi romance novel called “The Host”, which initially had a print run of 750,000 copies. Even though Meyer’s work is intended to be a trilogy, so far “The Host” is the only book published in the series. Nevertheless, it achieved a fairly decent amount of success, especially when it was adapted into a film of the same name, which came out in 2013. With <a href=#>Saoirse Ronan</a>, Jake Abel, Max Irons and Willem Hurt in the main roles, the movie grossed over $63 million at the box office, yet it was largely criticized for its storyline and script by many critics. Among Meyer’s other works are “The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner” and “The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide”.</p><p>In regards to her personal life, Stephenie Meyers is married to Christian Meyer, whom she had known since she was four years old.
