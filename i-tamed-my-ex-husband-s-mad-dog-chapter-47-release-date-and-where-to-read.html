The Man claims that Frederick Schneider, Johanna’s husband, is who he really is. Johanna becomes red in the face when Reinhardt calls her “Johanna Schneider,” but she quickly recovers to explain that the incident occurred soon after Reinhardt left for Luden.</p><p>After promising to see Reinhardt again soon, Johanna leaves. Reinhardt wonders aloud what might have made Johanna’s husband feel uneasy upon first meeting her. Wilhelm asks Reinhardt about Johanna, wanting to know if she had any long-term companions.</p><p>Wilhelm receives a bear embrace from Reinhardt, who tells him the importance of treating others with kindness. In response, Wilhelm argues that Reinhardt shouldn’t make an effort to put himself in other people’s shoes if they themselves don’t.</p><p>Reinhardt tells Wilhelm that Johanna sought out Luden because she was in anguish as well. Before Reinhardt could continue, the announcement announcing the Emperor and Empress’s entrance cut him off.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Wilhelm wants to know if Reinhardt would treat him the same if he were to commit a sin. Wilhelm’s question catches Reinhardt off guard, so he tells him to pick up where they left off later.</p><p>As they wait for the Emperor to arrive, Wilhelm and Reinhardt stand hand in hand. The Emperor visits Reinhardt’s house after first meeting Fernaha Glencia. Wilhelm and Reinhardt offer their greetings to His Majesty, and the Emperor inquires as to how she is doing. Reinhardt expresses gratitude to the Empress, who doesn’t appear thrilled.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-824 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Read More-&nbsp;<a href=#>Ijiranaide Nagatoro-San Chapter 139 Release Date and Where To Read</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunCx0qmmq6yjZLZuwMCmnJ1lna56psSMoaysmpGjsbR5zJqbZpyfnHqktMCpq56qXWmEbr7EpZyaq5VisaLAxGaYp5xdrLWmvsRmq6hlopqupXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
