I knew he was extra special. I had such a crush on him like nobody's frickin' business. I was just like, "Why do I feel so comfortable with him?" I'm that little prepubescent teenage girl feeling so comfortable with him. It was probably because he was gay. I think young girls, their first crushes are gay men. It's a non-threat. Now I look at it and think, "Oh my God, he was gay. That's why I liked him. It was safe and he was gorgeous and stunning, and that amazing voice. And he was shaking that ass." He really resonated with me. Later I was in his music video "Too Funky." I went from being in love with him to being like, "You're fierce, bitch!"</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>[When she began to question about the natural of beauty and the role race played]: I know that I got the covers of those magazines and that I had a very successful commercial side of the modeling industry. I think it had to do with my coloring and the fact that my eyes were green and my hair is sandy and my skin is caramel-colored. And I look at who society puts on a pedestal when it comes to black beauty, and a lot of the times it's a biracial girl, or a girl that does have lighter skin. I have made it one of the missions of my life to redefine and to open up the small box of what beautiful is.</td></tr><tr readability=14><td>4</td><td>[Who said about her teenage years in Los Angeles that being a supermodel wasn't a goal nor a dream]: It wasn't something that I always wanted to do -- it wasn't like I grew up and looked at magazines and said, 'Oooh, that's so glamorous, I wanna do that.' It found me. I was thin, I was 98 pounds, I was 5 foot 9, I was an inch shorter than I am now. So that is not just supermodel thin, that's just like, what's-wrong-with-her thin, and I had very low self-esteem because nothing I could do would make me gain weight.</td></tr><tr readability=5.3214285714286><td>5</td><td>[on her decision to end <a href=#>The Tyra Banks Show</a> (2005) in 2010]: I've been loving having fun, coming into your living rooms, bedrooms, hair salons for the past five years.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>6</td><td>My next huge steps will allow me to reach more women and young girls to help us all feel as fierce as we truly are. There's a lot cooking right now and a lot of fire burning in my heart. And I salute you my amazing family of viewers; without you there never would have been a 'Tyra Show.' I really love you all.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>7</td><td>[on re-evaluating her eating habits by keeping a food diary]: I switched up my unhealthy eating habits for healthier eating habits, and I haven't had a tummy attack since December '08.</td></tr><tr readability=5.6307692307692><td>8</td><td>[on watching <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> (1998), while exercising]: I got rid of one of my couches in my living room and I watched Sex and The City episodes on the treadmill or the elliptical, so Sex and the City lasts 30 minutes - that's how long I'm on the elliptical.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>9</td><td>[About her longtime struggled with chronic stomach aches]: I would get major attacks.
