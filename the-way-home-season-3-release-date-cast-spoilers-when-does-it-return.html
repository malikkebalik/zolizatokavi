Keep reading for everything there is to know about <a href=# rel=noopener>Season 3 of The Way Home</a>, including when it will premiere.</p><p>Hallmark’s The Way Home is a multi-generational time-travel drama that centers on Kat (Chyler Leigh) and Alice (Sadie Laflamme-Snow), a mother and daughter who move back to Kat’s small hometown of Port Haven, Canada, at a crossroads in their lives. Once there, they reconnect with Kat’s estranged mother Del (Andie McDowell) and learn that they have the ability to time travel by way of a mysterious pond on their family’s property. The series first premiered in January 2023 and instantly became one of cable’s five most-watched original entertainment series of that year.</p><p>In the Season 1 finale, Kat and Alice realized that Kat’s younger brother Jacob, who went missing years prior in 1999, fell into the pond and <a href=# rel=noopener>ended up stuck in the 1800s</a>. Season 2 picked up right where the show left off, with Kat traveling to 1814 and finding a <a href=# rel=noopener>now-adult Jacob</a> (played by Spencer MacPherson) alive and well.&nbsp;The finale featured several shocking twists and left fans with plenty of questions, but thankfully, the series has been renewed for a third season. We have all the details on Season 3 below.</p><h2>When does The Way Home return for Season 3?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kat-and-Elliot.jpg alt="The Way Home" width=1065 height=621 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When does The Way Home return for Season 3? Unfortunately, fans have a ways to go before they can get some answers to their burning questions.</p><p>The Way Home&nbsp;earned a swift Season 3 renewal in March 2024, just before the Season 2 finale aired. An exact premiere date has not been set, but it is expected to return in 2025. Since both Season 1 and Season 2 had January premiere dates, Season 3 will most likely premiere at the start of the year as well.</p><p>“Once again, our cast, writers and entire crew have used their impressive talents to create a story that is just as compelling and addictive as the first season,” Lisa Hamilton Daly, EVP of Programming at Hallmark Media, said in a statement. “We’re grateful to the fans who are so passionate about the series and can’t wait for them to see what and when is ahead for Season 3.”</p><p>VP of Development Kelly Garrett added: “Heather Conkie, Alexandra Clarke and Marly Reed continue to blow us away with the cleverly crafted story they’ve created and careful thought they put into every single detail. While some questions will be answered by the end of this season, the Landrys’ journey is far from over and there’s much more to tell.”</p><p>The cast for Season 3 has also not been confirmed, but Andie MacDowell, Chyler Leigh, Evan Williams and Sadie Laflamme-Snow will all most likely return. Hallmark shared a video of the four actors reacting to the news of the show’s renewal on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, captioned: “#Breaking! #TheWayHome Cast reacts to news about Season 3 coming in 2025! Join #AndieMacDowell @chy_leigh @sadie_snow and @evanmwilliams and share your reactions in the comments!”</p><p>Fans were thrilled about the renewal, with one commenting on the post: “Yayyyyyy this is wonderful news. Congratulations 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻.” A second fan wrote, “<span class="_ap3a _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade" dir=auto>This is my favorite show on TV, When Sunday night ends I can’t wait till the next one. Every single actor has been great.”</span></p><p>Another cast member who will most likely return is Season 2 addition Vaughan Murrae, who stars as Casey Goodwin. At the very end of the Season 2 finale, it was revealed that Casey is most likely a time traveler and a Landry. Not much is known about the character, but we suspect that they will be an integral part of Season 3. Kat’s late father Colton (Jefferson Brown) was also revealed to be a time traveler, so fans can expect to see more of him in Season 3 as well. Additionally, since adult Jacob returned home to present day in the finale, Spencer MacPherson will likely reprise his role. Fans are already looking forward to seeing his reunion with Del and have a lot of questions about how he’ll explain where he’s been all this time.</p><p>The other big reveal from the Season 2 finale was that Thomas Coyle (Kris Holden-Ried), whom Kat developed feelings for while visiting 1814, did not actually die like Kat was led to believe. The pair confessed their feelings for each other and shared a kiss just before he was shot by Cyrus Goodwin. In the final few minutes, however, Jacob informed his sister that Thomas survived, which will make for an interesting love triangle in Season 3, as Elliot Augustine (Evan Williams) also expressed his feelings for her in the present day.</p>Season 2 of The Way Home can be streamed on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Peacock</a>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmiEdXyOrZ%2BeZaeWxm60zqacZquVlsCwuoxsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
