It is unknown where the two met and how long they dated before getting married.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But initially, they denied the dating rumors. They&nbsp;were asked if they were in a relationship&nbsp;at the 2006 Instyle Golden Globes Party. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress said that she was not answering the question. However, shortly after, in October 2006, it was reported that the pair got <a href=# rel="follow noopener">engaged</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Jennifer Esposito's first spouse, Bradley Cooper, posing for a photo.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cooper's reps confirmed it, but they did not give more information about the engagement. Two months later, the pair tied the knot in the South of France.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">marriage</a> was a private and intimate affair. But the couple's marriage only lasted for four months.&nbsp;</p><p>Esposito <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed for divorce</a>&nbsp;citing irreconcilable differences. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to the court papers, she asked for spousal support and requested denial of any financial support for her spouse.&nbsp;</p><p>She also asked her husband to pay her legal fees. Her representatives said that she was seeking privacy during that time.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Cooper's representatives said the split was mutual, and the pair had actually "been separated for quite a while."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It is reported that the divorce was officially finalized in November 2007.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The&nbsp;American Sniper star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened up</a> about his divorce while talking with <a href=# rel=follow>Howard Stern</a> in 2011. He confessed the split was "just something that happened."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The relationship "just was not right" for the couple, and thankfully, both of them realized it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It is speculated that Esposito called her former husband names like "master manipulator" in her book, Jennifer's Way.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the book</a> was about her celiac disease, she has briefly talked about one of her marriages. She has not explicitly said it was about Cooper, but many presume it was about him.&nbsp;</p><p>Esposito wrote how there were red flags in their marriage from the beginning, but she ignored them.</p><p>She expected nothing to happen between them, but later, they got engaged.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actress did not find him attractive but thought she "could enjoy his sense of humor and nonsense for a while."</p><p>The relationship admittedly was just about her spouse, and it did not vibe well with the actress.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, she went along with it and got married. Soon, it "hit an all-time low, and within a week, it was over." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jennifer&nbsp;Esposito's Other Marriages</h2><p>After the divorce, Cooper dated multiple women but did not get married again.</p><p>He was dating&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Renée Zellweger</a> from 2009 to 2011, <a href=# rel=follow>Zoe Saldana</a>&nbsp;in 2012, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Suki Waterhouse</a> from 2013 to 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>His first long-term relationship was with supermodel&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Irina Shayk</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The pair got pregnant with their daughter,&nbsp;Lea de Seine Shayk Cooper, in May 2017.
