Former GMA meteorologist is the recipient of four Emmy awa</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Sam Champion is one of the most sought-after meteorologists in the news industry with a career spanning over 25 years of covering the weather for various channels.</p><p>Before landing the big role of the Chief Meteorologist of ‘<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a>’ in 2006, Sam toiled as a weekend weather anchor at Eyewitness News and later became the weekend anchor and news reporter at WPSD-TV in Kentucky. His career is a testament to the qualities of a hard-hitting journalist and his staggering net worth shows that.</p><p>Sam is one of the most handsomely paid meteorologists in the business, making close to $1.5M per year, with the number looking to skyrocket as his popularity grows. The 61-year-old’s dedicated service as a weatherman for three decades has also set him on the course of improving his net worth which now stands on a high line.</p><h2 class=split>What is Sam Champion’s net worth?</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Former ‘GMA’ stars Amy Robach and TJ Holmes take a morning jog in California ahead of their podcast together</a></p><p>The current weather anchor of WABC has amassed a net worth of $10M as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a>. It’ll come as a surprise to many that Sam earned a BA in Broadcast Journalism but doesn’t have a degree in meteorology, unlike other meteorologists.</p><p>Most of the knowledge he gained over the years was from working as a broadcaster for WABC-TV, WPSD-TV, WKYT-TV, the Weather Channel, and ABC. However, It’s not only a successful career as a weatherman that helped Sam build his fortune. The former ‘GMA’ meteorologist's calculated investments in real estate have also made him some dough.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ca2be0a4-da95-48be-b86b-b8869cf95cc8.472798852><p>In 2014, Sam sold his Upper West Side condo for $4.7 million, while he had bought it for $750,000 in 1995, as reported by 6Sqft. Through the sale, Sam pocketed a profit of $4 million and the ‘ABC’ weatherman is about to sell his Miami condo for nearly $2 million, which is again expected to make him a huge profit.</p><p>Sam isn’t shy to make public appearances to boost his personal brand and even participated in Season 31 of ‘Dancing with the Stars' in 2022. For his distinguished service as a weatherman, Sam has been bestowed with four Emmy awards. He's also married to Rubem Robierb, a successful artist and photographer who he met in Miami.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>GMA's Michael Strahan ends social media blackout to support fellow NFL star as daughter Sophia shares beaming Christmas snap</a></p><h2 class=split>Sam Champion and Rubem Robierb extended vacation in Italy&nbsp;</h2><p>The 61-year-old meteorologist recently took an extended break from his duties in the studio and vacationed in Italy with his husband, Rubem.
