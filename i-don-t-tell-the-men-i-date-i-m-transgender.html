woman has revealed she doesn’t tell men she’s transgender straight away as people are “too judgmental” – saying she likes to wait until she’s sure she wants to take things further.</p><p>Adea Danielle, 22, always felt like there was something “missing” when she was growing up and at aged 16, after stumbling across a YouTube video, realized she was transgender.</p><p>After realizing she was the “wrong body”, Adea told her mom and soon after began her journey to becoming a woman, including embarking on hormone therapy before undergoing gender-affirming surgery in 2021.</p><figure

the fact she’s transgender</a> to men, which is often met with backlash.</p><p>“[People tell me] I’m lying to them or that I’m deceiving them,” she said.</p><p>“There’s so much judgment around the trans label and if a guy were to learn that I’m trans before, he would make up a whole idea of how I am and how I must act.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A

so I just tell them when I’m interested and when I want to take things further.”</p><p>Adea explained <a href=#>it’s common when dating not to disclose</a> your full past until the relationship has developed.</p><p>“It’s my past and you’re not going to meet someone and tell them everything that happened in your past,” she said.</p><p>“[Online] guys often comment ‘Oh you’re lying to men’ but then how can they say <a href=#>I’m lying if I present myself as a woman?</a></p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Keep up with today's most important news</h3><p

saying I’m a man.”</p><p>Growing up, Adea recalls dressing in her mum’s clothes and wanting to play with her sister’s toys and believes her family knew she was “different.”</p><p>While her mum was very accepting, her dad wasn’t on board at first – but she said now, he’s her biggest supporter.</p><p>Adea also believes not much is known about transgender people outside of the community, saying it’s often thought that people “wake up” and decide their gender – when in fact, it’s not a choice.</p><p>Previously, Adea hit the headlines after revealing the complications she suffered after undergoing Brazilian butt lift (BBL) surgery.</p><p>She claims that the pain left her feeling like she was being “burned alive”.</p><p>Adea has also <a href=#>undergone gender-affirming surgery,</a> which while she said she’s glad it was a success, stressed it wasn’t easy.</p><p>“On the first night, they had to put gauze in between my stitches, and the next day, they couldn’t take them out as I had bled out,” she said of the painful surgery.</p><p>“I had blood clots where I couldn’t pee anymore and so they had to leave it in.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image

Press/@adee.ah</span></figure><p>“It was so intense.”</p><p>She also had an issue with the function of her new vagina, which has since been corrected, but it caused her to struggle emotionally.</p><p>“It was a really difficult time for me because I went from having something in between my legs that I hated to this,” she said.</p><p>“I would never touch it and disconnected with that area [of my body].”</p><p>Adea feels it is important to share her story and has garnered immense support online.</p><p>“When I started transitioning, one of my biggest fears was the judgment that I would get walking into the community,” she revealed.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Adea Danielle feels it is important to share her story and has garnered

claims that after coming out as transgender, she lost over 50,000 followers on social media – and while this hurt at first, she’s now focusing on her future and happiness.</p><p>“You can’t care about what anyone else has to say and just shut everyone out,” she said.</p><p>“Concentrate on yourself and focus on where you were in the past [compared to now] and not where others are.”</p><p
