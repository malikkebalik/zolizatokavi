The same year he appeared with the actress on “Saturday Night Live” and in the film “Beethoven’s 2nd”, the sequel to the hit film “Beethoven” of the previous year, making his film debut with the supporting role of Taylor Devereaux. He went on to receive a starring role as Michael in a foreign-made drama film “Lost in Africa” the following year. In 1997 he had a recurring role as Cole Deschanel in the NBC soap opera “Sunset Beach”, but was dropped from the show a month after its premiere.</p><p>The year 2001 saw Hamilton as Maurice Dupres in the Spanish-British-Italian comedy film “Off Key” starring his father <a href=#>George Hamilton</a>, then appeared as Ben in the indie film “Sluts & Losers” of the same year. Over the next several years he made guest appearances in the television series “Oz” and “Femme Fatales”, and appeared in the TV films “Dreamweaver” and “P Lo’s House”. In 2012 he was cast as Bruce in the indie comedy-drama film “Lost Angeles” and the following year as an Extremis soldier Jack Taggert in the popular film “Iron Man 3”. All contributed to his net worth.</p><p>Hamilton’s next roles were in the 2014 thriller “Phantom Halo”, and in the short film “Implant” of the same year. In 2015 he was cast as Kurt in the film “Cats Dancing on Jupiter”, and starred in the E! reality documentary television series about his own family, “Stewarts & Hamiltons”. His most recent film appearance has been in the upcoming comedy-drama film “Rules Don’t Apply”. His net worth is still rising.</p><p>Aside from his acting career, Hamilton is a singer and songwriter.
