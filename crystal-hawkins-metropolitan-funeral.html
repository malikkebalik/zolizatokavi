Crystal said “goodnight “ on this side of Heaven and “good morning “ on the other side to begin her eternal life!</p><p>Crystal Paulette Hawkins was born October 15, 1958 to the union of her loving parents, John and Mackie Jones in Muskegon, Michigan. She was their third and final child and was treated as such even being nicknamed “Doll” as her brother would run yelling “ Mama, that baby Doll is crying !” Pretty soon we all called her Doll and it stuck with her throughout her entire life. Crystal was raised in Muskegon Heights, Michigan and received her formal education in the Muskegon Heights Public School System graduating with the class of 1976. She furthered her education at Central Michigan University, Mt. Pleasant , MI and later attended ECPI, Virginia Beach, VA earning her Associates Degree in Business Management in 1988.</p><p>Crystal married Ronnie Hawkins, Sr. September 7, 1978 and to that union one son, Ronnie Hawkins, Jr. was born.</p><p>Crystal accepted the Lord at an early age and was baptized. She attended the&nbsp;Beulah Missionary Baptist Church under the leadership of the late Rev. J.M. Blow. She participated in Sunday School, Baptist Training Union, Vacation Bible School and the Youth Choir. Upon moving to Virginia Beach she became a member of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church and from 1985-1996 served as the Church Secretary. She also worked many years with the Youth Ministry including the Ushers, Choir and Children’s Church.</p><p>Doll’s life consisted of church, work, sports and watching movies on T.V.</p><p>She worked and retired from Sentara in Medical Records. For the past 18 years she was employed at I. C. Norcom SECEP as a Special Needs Teacher’s Assistant. She had a special gift caring for the children attending her classes. She was also very involved in the community. She could often be found at a soccer field or a basketball court supporting youth. Until her illness prevented her, she had not missed one game that her son or granddaughters played, coached or refereed. Ocean Lakes High School athletes, male and female, knew her as “Grandma” because she was always there to cheer them on. She touched so many lives and had many to love her and call her Mom or Grandma. Her life was totally completed by her son, two granddaughters and grandson who meant the world to her and she to them! Doll will certainly be missed by her family and friends.</p><p>Crystal leaves to cherish her memories her son; Ronnie Hawkins, Jr. of Virginia Beach, Va, two granddaughters; Quierra Jonee Hawkins and Nyasia Yvonnejanette Hawkins both of Virginia Beach, VA, one grandson, Darius LaMar Horton of Jacksonville, FL, one sister; Pamela (Tyrone) Hughes of Muskegon Heights, MI, one brother; Tommy (Anita) Jones of Muskegon, MI, ex-husband; Ronnie Hawkins, Sr. of Muskegon, MI, mother-in-law; Willean Turner, of Muskegon Heights, MI, two sisters-in-law; Brenda (Tim) Smith of Muskegon, MI and Avis Dawkins of Holland, MI, “adopted “ son Demetrius (Donna) Alexander, two god-sisters; Felicia (Edward) Williams and Dominique Smith, one god-brother; Henry (Carla) Smith, Jr., three god-daughters; Valencia Hatten, Krystal (Andre) Lewis, and Latecia Jones, one god-son; Lartice Rice, many nieces, nephews and cousins, friends, including her best friends; Patricia Richards, Alice Turner, Sandra (Cliff) Fitzgerald and Sherrae McGee, and last but not least; her Mt.
