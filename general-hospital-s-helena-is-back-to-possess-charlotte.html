Time and again, she’s been defeated, occasionally even “killed,” only to rise like the phoenix (wrong soap!) to cause more damage. This week, she has managed to do so yet again… this time using the youngest member of Laura’s extended family: granddaughter Charlotte!</p><p>“”All the years that I spent worrying about Nikolas, trying to wave him from the darkness that he inherited from the Cassadines,” mused Laura to Kevin. “I never dreamed that Charlotte would have to battle the same demons.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/laura-kevin-warns-gh-abc.jpg alt="Kevin warns LAura GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But even as she fretted, upstairs, dark forces appeared to be gathering as the object of her concern, Charlotte, stared into the mirror, almost as if transfixed by the necklace dangling from her neck. The same necklace once owned by Helena herself, and gifted to the pre-teen by Victor’s will.</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Laura Wright’s son grew up before our eyes!</a></p><p>Now, it seems a battle is brewing with nothing less than Charlotte’s proverbial soul on the line. Kevin speculated that the girl’s obsession might involve her searching for role models, especially in the wake of all that she’s been through in her young life. “People that she feels are powerful, survivors,” he suggested to Laura. “Unfortunately, Helena, Victor… in other words, the darker figures in the family, certainly qualify.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Is-Helena-really-dead-gh-jpi-hw1.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But maybe, just maybe, Charlotte will realize that she doesn’t have to look far for strong role models. Who has survived more during the course of her lifetime than the girl’s much-loved grandmother, Laura? From raging waterfalls to vengeance-seeking mobsters, Laura’s been there, seen that, worn the t-shirt and resold it for twice its value.</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Two more exiting&nbsp;General Hospital</a></p><p>And not for nothing, but she’s gone head-to-head with Helena more often than anyone else on the canvas. While looking at the Cassadine necklace, Charlotte uttered, “Anything for family.” She may have been almost unwittingly channeling dark energy from (supposedly) dead ancestors, but she might just as well have been reading the title of Laura’s as-yet-unwritten biography.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kevin-laura-charlotte-gh-abc.jpg alt="Charlotte is happy GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Helena has always been a formidable woman and scary presence. But if she dares to try possessing Charlotte — literally or figuratively — in an effort to breath new life into her old curse, our money is going to be on Laura every single time!</p><p><strong>There are more than a few bad apples lurking in the <a href=# rel=noopener>twisted branches of Cassadine family tree</a>, as we detail in the gallery below.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvNnq6sZ2dmfnaAmGigrGWYmrmmusBmmZqbm2Kwqa3RpaatrJVivbC%2F0p6qrJ2UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
