Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Pop Sugar</a>‘s last count in May, Drizzy was already passed 55 tats, including <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>his mom’s initials on his face that he got last summer</a>, a <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>portrait of his father on his arm</a>, a <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>tribute to the late Virgil Abloh</a> and many more.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>This isn’t the first tat dedicated to his five-year-old either, as <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Drizzy debuted portraits of Adonis, producer Noah “40” Shebib, Aaliyah, Denzel Washington and Lil Wayne across his back</a> in summer 2020.</p><p>Check out pics of the latest ink below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drake gets tattoo of son’s name on back of his neck <a href=#>https://t.co/52WCdDsvQr</a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sDxHmuLFyF</a></p><p>— HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) <a href=#>August 7, 2023</a></p><p>Back in February, the<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener> 6 God and his son Adonis were the special guests on an episode of Sundae Conversation with Barstool Sports’ Caleb Pressley</a>. The conversation was full of hilarious and heartwarming moments – including Drizzy speaking on being a dad and Adonis shedding light on his father’s parenting skills.</p><p>The five-year-old opened the interview by speaking about his friends before switching the topic to his dad, who was sitting beside him.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/01/5C60669C-ACE7-43FB-BA74-4E5240648C52-250x142.jpeg alt="Drake Quotes Pusha T Lyric While Sharing Father-Son Moment With Adonis" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Drake Quotes Pusha T Lyric While Sharing Father-Son Moment With Adonis</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>January 31, 2022</p></a><p>After Adonis admitted he’s not the strongest reader, Pressley asked Adonis: “Do you think if he did a better job with you at home that you’d be able to read?” To which the curly-haired kid jokingly replied: “Yeah.”</p><p>However, Adonis then saluted Drake for his sense of humor, calling him “a funny dad” and saying that he “does a lot of funny jokes.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>Pressley then began interviewing Drake and asked him hilarious questions such as if Adonis has ever “cock-blocked” him and if he walks around his Air Drake plane in just his boxers.</p><p>The topic of betting also came up, and Pressley asked Drizzy what he thinks is the best thing to put his chips on, and he wasted no time saying fatherhood is the way to go.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>“Fatherhood,” Drake replied. “I just mean, in an encouraging way, like, ‘You can always bet on fatherhood. For all the people out there, you can always bet on fatherhood.”</p><p>Adonis closed out the interview with a funny moment where he was gifted a Kawhi Leonard Los Angeles Clippers jersey. Pressley encouraged Adonis to say thank you, but the 6 God’s seed ignored him and instead said his favorite number is two.</p><p>That led Pressley to ask if Adonis likes to “go number two,” to which he unknowingly replied: “Yeah” before saying “Bye-bye” and that he is “a shooting star.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibq5mbmnq1rdOtpqhlo6S7tHnNmqSeZZ6asKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
