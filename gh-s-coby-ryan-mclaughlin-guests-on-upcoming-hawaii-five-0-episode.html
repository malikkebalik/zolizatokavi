He’ll appear as Luke in the episode titled Loa‘a pono ka ‘iole i ka pūnana, which is Hawaiian for the rat was caught right in the nest. In the episode Grover (Chi McBride) and Five-0 investigate a murder at a private golf course involving a man who was frozen to death in the locker room’s cryo-chamber. Also, McGarrett (Alex O’Loughlin) tags along with Danny (Scott Caan) when he tracks down the father of a boy who has been bullying Charlie (Zach Sulzbach).</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson West in Like it was Yesterday</a></p><p>Hawaii Five-0 is in its tenth season and is a modern take on the classic series about an elite federalized task force whose mission is to wipe out the crime that washes up on the islands’ sun-drenched beaches. While much of the cast has changed over the years, the two main stars Naval officer turned cop Detective Steve McGarrett (O’Loughlin) and his partner ex-New Jersey cop Detective Danny Williams (Caan) remain. They are the heart of Hawaii Five-0 and are aided by Captain Lou Grover (McBride), who formerly headed Hawaii’s SWAT unit. Along with him is Tani Rey (Meaghan Rath), a recent police academy graduate. Junior Reigns (Beulah Koale) is a former SEAL who joined the team after McGarrett gave him a job. And there is Quinn Liu (Katrina Law) a former Staff Sergeant with Army CID who was recently demoted for insubordination. Sometimes assisting is Adam Noshimuri (Ian Anthony Dale), a friend with ties to a deadly crime family. The team often relies on medical examiner Dr. Noelani Cunha (Kimee Balmilero) to help solve their cases and Kamekona (Taylor Wily), a local food truck vendor who has his pulse on the Island.</p><p>McLaughlin isn’t the only daytime star to appear in Hawaii Five-0.
