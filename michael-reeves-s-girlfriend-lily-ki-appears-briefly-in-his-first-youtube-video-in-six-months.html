It was about yet another unconventional invention where his girlfriend, singer, Twitch streamer, and YouTuber Lily Ki, better known as LilyPichu, made a cameo appearance. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Back With a Bang</h2><p>Prior to coming back to YouTube, Reeves <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> he had forgotten to make YouTube videos for 6 months. This led fans to speculate he would upload a new video soon. &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Two days later on April 9, 2021, he ended his break by uploading his invention — a robot dog that could urinate beer into a cup. He was exited to finally get his hands on the amusing creation by Boston Dynamics after months of waiting.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Reeves initially teased this idea in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> in July 2020 with his fellow member of OfflineTV, Disguised Toast. Reeves said he would program it to urinate beer in a cup. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Imagine you’re at a party and you’re like where’s the drinks? Oh, just go to the robot dog.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Fast forward 9 months, it was exactly what the brilliant engineer did. He designed a pressure pump and mechanical phallus for the dog, which was then programmed to stand over a red cup to urinate beer.</p><p>After a couple of tries, a small tank of beer was then mounted on top of the dog. He named his invention “Pissbot 9000.” Messy, but definitely impressive.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Reeves wanted to show his creation to Boston Dynamics via a zoom call, but they didn’t respond. Hence, Reeves traveled all the way to Boston from LA to show them his invention.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He drove for 8 days and 2,988 miles with his girlfriend and fellow OTV member, LilyPichu. He showed his college, Northern Arizona University, and dorm, which he claimed to hate a lot.</p><p>While Reeves claimed he wanted to show “Pissbot 9000” to Boston Dynamics, he ended the video by just standing in front of the building and making the robot urinate in front of it.&nbsp;</p><p>LilyPichu can be heard saying, “Wait, that’s it?” at the end, shocked. Reeves mentioned her in the video’s description, thanking her for coming with him all the way to Boston to record a 10-second meme. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><br><p><strong>Michael Reeves and Lily Ki.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Reeves And His Girlfriend, Lily Ki&nbsp;</h2><p>Prior to dating Reeves, LilyPichu was in a public relationship with another Twitch Streamer and musician, Albert Chang, better known as Sleightlymusical.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, the relationship fell apart after two years since Chang had cheated on her. In November 2019, both <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LilyPichu</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chang</a> made a statement on Twitter regarding their public and messy breakup.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After their breakup, there were speculations about Reeves and LilyPichu dating, which was confirmed by the musician when she uploaded a video in February 2020.<img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The duo has been together since then. The musician was accused of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cheating</a> once, but she discredited such rumors in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>LilyPichu seems to be head over heels for Reeves. She gushed about him in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">twitch stream</a> with her best friend Aria, saying she fell in love with him because he fixed everything, listened to her, and made her feel comfortable. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>At first, she didn’t want to be in a relationship and was sure that she would remain single for the rest of the year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The same seems to be the case for Reeves. His fellow OTV member, Imane Anys aka Pokimane, reacted to his recent video about the robot dog on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">live stream</a>.</p><p>She revealed there were only three things that make him smile like that: LilyPichu, their dog Temmie, and some form of frightening mechanical engineering advancement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKhdmMKtwNSrnGilmZi1orHLZqmenaaawLR5xqKppZ6inrKvsIyloKWxXaC2bq3PqZyaqqNir7O1xJ%2BjsmWZo3qptdJmnaKqo6l6urvUraybnV2rtqWxzmagp2WjnsVuuc6nq6GrXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
