She first drew public attention with her performance in “Stardom” in 2000, followed by “Lost and Delirious” in 2001. Her other notable roles include “Lives of the Saints” and “Random Passage,” for which her performance was so brilliant that the entire program was nominated for a Gemini Award twice. Jessica is engaged in American productions, where she has some of her best and most critically acclaimed performances, in addition to Canadian films and shows.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Jessica_Pare_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Jessica Pare? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Jessica Pare has a <strong>net worth</strong> of around $2 million, according to official sources, as of 2022, gained from performances in a diverse range of movies and TV shows, both in Canada and the United States. If she continues to choose the proper portions, her fortune may increase in the near future.</p><h2><span id=Jessica_Pare-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Jessica Pare- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Jessica was born into a French-Canadian family; her father, Anthony Pare, was the chairman of the Education department at McGill University, and her mother, Louise Mercier, was a conference interpreter with a multi-decade career. She grew up in one of Montreal’s wealthier neighborhoods, Notre-Dame-de-Grace, with three elder brothers. She studied French and English as a child due to her mother’s urging.</p><p>If you’re wondering why Jessica chose acting, look no farther than her mother and father, who both dabbled in amateur shows and taught theatre. Jessica stated that she grew interested in acting after rehearsing lines from “The Tempest” with her father. When she was eight years old, she had her first acting role in “The Baby-Sitters Club,” in the episode “Mary Anne and the Brunettes.” Most people are unaware that her predecessors were also celebrities — her great-grandfather, Alphonse Pare, was a famous engineer, and her mother is descended from Elizabeth Griffith, an 18th-century Welsh-Irish actress, playwright, and essayist.</p><h2><span id=Jessica_Pare-_Relationship_Married_Life>Jessica Pare- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>She married Joseph Smith, a writer, and producer, in 2007, but they divorced in 2010. Jessica was photographed holding hands with John Kastner, the singer of popular Canadian hardcore band The Asexuals, in mid-2012; she even performed with them on several occasions. The couple welcomed their first child, a boy named Blues Anthony Paré Kastner, into the world on March 19, 2015.</p><p>She applied for a modeling job as a teenager but was turned down because she was ‘too heavy.’ Another interesting detail about this great actress is that she was so desperate to succeed in her role in “Suck” that she learned to play the bass.</p><h2><span id=Jessica_Pare-_Professional_Career>Jessica Pare- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Jessica enrolled in Villa Maria, a famous all-girl Catholic high school in Montreal, in 1995. During her senior year, she landed a role in a small-time television movie called “Bonanno: A Godfather’s Story,” which was well-received by both her friends and critics, prompting her to consider acting as a genuine career. She enrolled in Dawson College after graduating from Villa Maria, with an emphasis on their fine arts department, but she rarely attended classes, mostly because she was studying drama at TheatreWorks at the same time. Pare finally dropped out of college to pursue an acting career and, perhaps, establish a name for herself.</p><h3><span id=Beginnings_of_a_Career_TV_Movies_Big_Wolf_on_Campus_and_Stardom>Beginnings of a Career: TV Movies, Big Wolf on Campus, and Stardom</span></h3><p>Jessica began acting at the age of ten, and her first major roles were in “Bonanno: A Godfather’s Story” and “Big Wolf on Campus,” in which she tried her hand at two very different but equally difficult forms of acting. This catapulted her to the role of Tina Menzhal in “Stardom,” a story about a young girl who is inadvertently’sucked into the world of supermodels, glamour, and crazy parties. Almost shortly after, she starred in “en Vacances” (“Holiday” in English), a 2000 French film about a family reflecting on their Christmas predictions from ten years before. Her performance in “Lost and Delirious” was generally lauded as “candid and wonderful,” and she went on to star in “Posers,” a 2003 film about a group of females who decide to create a gang. Jessica played Nancy Eaton in the 2004 film “Deadly Friends.”</p><p>Jessica also dabbled in photography during this time, occasionally working as an assistant photographer at car events and photoshoots.</p><h3><span id=Success_Continues_Jack_Bobby_Satisfaction_Mad_Men>Success Continues: Jack & Bobby, Satisfaction, Mad Men</span></h3><p>Jessica is also remembered by fans for her appearance in 21 episodes of “Jack & Bobby,” a teen drama about two brothers who bicker a lot as kids but one grows up to become President of the United States. Following that, she gave outstanding performances in “Satisfaction,” “The Trotsky,” and “Brooklyn.” Her most notable career triumph, however, was her portrayal of Megan Draper in “Mad Men,” in which she co-starred with John Hamm and Elisabeth Moss and appeared in 49 episodes. Jessica has been less active in recent years, although her one consistent part is as Mandy Ellis in “SEAL Team,” a series about the most perilous top-secret missions carried out by US Navy SEALs.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Jessica Pare is <strong>5ft 9in (175cm)</strong> tall, weighs approximately <strong>132lbs (60kgs)</strong>, and has the following vital statistics: 35-25-35. Her eyes are blue, and her hair is dark brown, almost black.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Jessica, like every other actress, recognizes the value of social media as a marketing tool and a means of engaging with her audience. She does not, however, wish to reveal too much about her personal life on the internet. As a result, she only has Instagram and Facebook profiles, with 50,000 and 2,600 followers, respectively.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Abilio James Acosta</a>, <a href=#>Ladd Drummond</a>, and <a href=#>Ryans Williams</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Musician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Everything You Should Know About Jessica Plummer And Ben Hardy Relationship</a></h3>On August 19, 2021, The Sun revealed exclusively that fans spotted Hardy and Jessica Plummer at Jade Bird's London concert.
