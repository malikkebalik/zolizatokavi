He’s been active on the site since 2010, and all of his endeavors have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Unbox Therapy? As of late-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $3 million, mostly earned through his success on YouTube, as he’s also worked with other YouTube channels as well as other businesses. He’s also made a presence through social media websites, and as he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Unbox Therapy Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>Growing up, Unbox Therapy already had a passion for technology and new innovations. After matriculating from high school, he attended the Toronto School of Art, where he studied photography, video editing and digital arts, with the aim of using these skills. He then created a computer service and repair store in Toronto called iUpgrade, the basis of his net worth, helping with various computer issues, and then ventured onto YouTube, uploading some of these tutorial videos online. After he started gaining more attention online, he focused on trying his hand at a YouTube career.</p><p>He created Unbox Therapy in 2010, with the aim of unboxing gadgets or products for the first time to test them out. The channel has grown hugely in popularity, with his uploads gaining millions of views within days, and his net worth increased significantly. Some of the things he’s tested out on the channel include laptops, game consoles, and various Apple products. Thanks to his popularity, many companies decided to send their products for him to review, before they are released publicly. His most popular video is the iPhone 6 Plus Bend Test which has attracted around 70 million views, with some of his other popular videos having over 10 million views. He’s also been featured on news channels such as CNN and Bloomberg, adding to his popularity and net worth.</p><p>Unbox Therapy’s video on bending the iPhone 6 plus has caused a bit of controversy, as many believe he was making false allegations in the clip. This prompted him to respond and upload an unedited version of the video. In 2013, he collaborated with Ali-A for his “Gaming Setup & Room Tour” which also found a bit of popularity. The following year, he decided to create another channel called “More Top 5” which is a list content channel, which has also proven popular, with some videos gaining over one million views. He’s also consistently worked with Quarterly.co which is a service that delivers monthly packages selected by a celebrity or expert.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Unbox Therapy is married and he has a child.
