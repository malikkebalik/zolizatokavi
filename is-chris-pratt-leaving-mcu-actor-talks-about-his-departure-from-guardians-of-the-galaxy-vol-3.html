Like, this is going away. I want to take it in. You can’t take it in any harder than just being present to it. So I’m being present. The other day, Russell Wilson, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback, he got traded to Denver. He’s been with Seattle for about ten years. Which has been about the duration of this. I was like, Wait, hold on, what happened? The emotion around the last ten years sort of coming to an end. I was in the most embarrassing way, like, My quarterback leaves, so I’m gonna cry. It’s hitting me in moments like that," he told <a title="Men’s Health" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Men’s Health.</a></p><p>Discussing his future in Hollywood and how he doesn’t have any ten-year plan since he is uncertain about what’s going to come next, Pratt added, “I don’t actually know what’s gonna come next. You asked whether or not I’m cognizantly, intentionally turning a page. The page is turning. Whether I want to or not. Because the franchises are over.”</p><p>Meanwhile, ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ Vol 3 will see Pratt essaying the character of Peter Quill / Star-lord who is the half-celestial and half-human leader of the ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ that had been kidnapped and abducted from the earth as a child and had been raised by a cluster of alien thieves and smugglers called ‘Ravagers’. In the last two films, we have seen how his character goes through many changes and experiences all highs and lows as well. This time though, audiences would be seeing how his character has evolved right from the start till now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5intrR5z6uYraxdnMKivsOimKerXaSzbsDHnmSgmZyWxbp5xaKjpmWWp66vr8eiqp5lnZjCbrDEqZirrKWnsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
