The medical doctor turned musician is 79 years old. There is no publicly available information about his family background.</p><p>Jhene Aiko’s father was born and raised in the United States, where he finished high school and went on to college to receive two medical degrees. He went to the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, where he eventually graduated in 1974. Following that, he furthered to Cape Western Reserve University School of Medicine located in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><h2><b>He has Mixed Ethnic Origins&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Dr. Karamo Chilombo and his family are thought to be primarily of black origin but they also have a fascinating, diverse ethnicity. That diverse ethnicity comprises other roots that can be traced to Asia, Europe, America, and the African continent.</p><p>In summary, Dr. Karamo Chilombo is partially black but has other ethnicities as well. His family collectively still has traces of other ethnicities, to which they can also lay claim. However, many people regard them as blacks, and there has been no controversy up to this point.</p><h2><strong>His Birth Name is Gregory Wycliff Barnes</strong></h2><p>Although Jhene Aiko’s father is famously known as Dr. Karamo Chilombo, and in most cases shortened to Dr. Chill, he wasn’t born with these names. His birth name is Gregory Wycliff Barnes, but at the age of 20 years, he decided to change it. Meanwhile, to a large extent, his real name has been overshadowed by his nickname, Dr. Chill, and his stage name, Dr. Karamo Chilombo.</p><p>He revealed that his love for music made him change his name to Chilomba, which means “wild beast” in Chewa. To add more glamour to the name, he always dressed in Jamaican attire.</p><h2><strong>Dr. Chill is a Licensed Medical Practitioner</strong></h2><p>It is rare to see someone practicing as a medical doctor while at the same time excelling in a musical career. The reason may be that they are two different careers that don’t have any relationship. However, this unrealistic factor was realized by Dr. Karamo Chilombo, who is a medical doctor and also a professional musician.</p><p>Most times, people assume that Dr. Karamo Chilombo is not a real doctor or that he is only using the title to make his name unique. However, he has been a medical doctor in America for over four decades. Dr. Karamo Chilombo is a pediatrician who specializes in treating infants, children, and adolescents.</p><p>Since receiving his medical license in 1978, Dr. Karamo Chilombo has worked with a few notable hospitals. According to reputable <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">sources</a>, Dr. Chill is currently employed by a community hospital in Los Angeles and is also connected to Monterey Park Hospital, which is located in the United States.</p><h2><strong>He is also a Musician with Several Tracks to his Name&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Dr. Karamo Chilombo has not only had a successful career in medicine, but he has also been able to marry his love of music with his passion for medicine. In fact, he’s frequently referred to as a “singing doctor” by many people.</p><p>He has some of his tracks available on YouTube as well as on digital music services like Spotify and Deezer. Wish Our Love, I Am Not Afraid, and The Sounds of Mother Africa are some of the well-known songs he has written. In addition to this, he has released songs alongside his daughter, Jhene Aiko, which are Oblivion, Surrender, and Psilocybin.</p><h2><strong>Dr. Karamo Was Married To Christina Yamamoto For 20 Years</strong></h2><p>Prior to becoming well-known, Dr. Karamo married Christina Yamamoto, a stunning woman, in 1980. Though they did not reveal how they met or how long they dated before getting married, Dr. Chill and his wife were married for 20 years. Unfortunately, their marriage could not stand the test of time, and they had to call it quits in 2000.</p><p>Even though their divorce occurred several years ago, they still haven’t stepped forward to discuss the reasons why their marriage failed. Nevertheless, Dr. Karamo Chilombo and <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Christina Yamamoto</a> gave birth to a total of five children, including two boys and three girls. Unfortunately, they lost their fourth child, Miyagi Chilombo to cancer in 2012.</p><h2><b>They Divorced in 2000 and He Moved on with Another Partner</b></h2><p>After his divorce from his first wife, Dr. Karamo Chilombo eventually moved on. He later got involved with a mystery woman, with whom he welcomed three children. The medical practitioner cum musician has remained tight-lipped about revealing the identity of his wife.</p><p>Compounding this, some sources claim that Dr. Chill is not legally married to his second wife. This isn’t entirely unreasonable given that there is no report of their wedding ceremony. Meanwhile, other reports still maintain that Dr. Chill is legally married to his second wife. The musician has remained silent amidst the rumor and has not confirmed or debunked it.</p><h2><strong>Meet Dr. Karamo Chilombo’s Children From His Marriage With Christina Yamamoto</strong></h2><p>Dr. Karamo Chilombo has a total of eight children out of which seven are still alive.
