Brad, 59, was seen filming his movie <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wolves</a>, while Ines, 29, was spotted running errands. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The couple</a> has been spending a lot of time together the past few months, but Brad obviously is very busy because of his job. The famous actor and the jewelry expert <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly began dating in November</a>, but they have yet to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirm their relationship</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brad-pitt-wolves-set-backgrid-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Ines spent the day shopping, Brad was on the set of his Apple TV+ movie that also stars his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ocean’s Eleven</a>‘s co-star&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>George Clooney</strong></a>. Brad was photographed talking on his cell phone as he got out of his car on the movie set. The Oscar winner wore a grey vest over a white shirt with dark grey pants and black dress shoes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ines, meanwhile, had on a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>super stylish outfit</a> as she ran errands in LA. Ines rocked a long-sleeved white turtleneck with tan pants and white sneakers. She also wore a gold necklace and a pair of brown sunglasses. Ironically, Ines was also on the phone in the paparazzi pictures. Maybe she was calling Brad?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brad-pitt-wolves-set-backgrid-embed02.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Brad and Ines have been linked since last fall, and they kicked off 2023 with a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantic vacation to Cabo</a>. For Valentine’s Day, Ines was spotted with a huge smile on as she carried a gorgeous<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> bouquet of flowers</a> from work, which was seemingly sent by Brad. At the end of February, they were seen<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> grabbing dinner during a getaway</a> to Paris. They’ve been pretty low-key since then, as Brad focuses on his new movie.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ines might really be the one for Brad, who was previously married to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Angelina Jolie</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>. The&nbsp;Babylon&nbsp;star is “smitten with Ines,” a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>source</a> told <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>EXCLUSIVELY in January, “and [he] always looks forward to spending as much time with her as possible.” The insider explained that “it’s too early to tell where things might go between them,” especially because Brad understands that Ines just ended a marriage. That’s in reference to Ines’ 2022 split from Vampire Diaries&nbsp;actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paul Wesley</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e49tZpuqkZl6sbXTrWSfoZyiwG7DzqWtnqtdnrumv4ydnGaqkaK8r3nSoaapq12ltbDAzqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
