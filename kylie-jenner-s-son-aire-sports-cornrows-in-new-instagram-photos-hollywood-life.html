In the carousel of photos, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kardashians</a>&nbsp;star rocked a see-through white t-shirt and a black <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leather mini skirt</a>. Kylie paired her top with what appeared to be a black bikini top underneath and an army-patterned trucker hat. “my big boy,” she captioned the post.</p><p lang=qme dir=ltr>🫶🏻 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/9WiWDC5f1l</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Kylie Jenner Source (@kyliajennur) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 14, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Of course, the cutest part of the photos was her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>little man</a>, who looked adorable in a white graphic t-shirt and beige jeans. Kylie also added a pair of black Vans sneakers to Aire’s outfit. The toddler sported stylish cornrows for his hairstyle of the day. In one of the slides, the one-year-old was pictured carrying a tiny toy car in his hand, as he leaned against his mother in the photos. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother-and-son</a> duo held the mini photoshoot in Kylie’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lavish backyard</a> near her stylish swimming pool.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Soon after the 25-year-old shared the photos with her nearly 400 million followers, many of them took to the comments to swoon over Aire and Kylie’s sweet moment. “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Motherhood</a> looks so good on her,” one fan quipped, while another agreed and added, “I love seeing Kylie as a mom.” Meanwhile, her family friend,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Malika Haqq</strong></a>, couldn’t help but also gush over the toddler. “His face,” the 40-year-old wrote, along with a heart eyes emoji. A few other admirers noted how much Aire looks like his mom. “He looks just like you Perfect baby,” a separate fan wrote, while another commented, “them kylie genetics are STRONG.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kylie-jenner-aire-son-new-photos-big-boy-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The Kylie Cosmetics founder’s latest photos with Aire come just one week after she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo dump</a> featuring her son and his older sister,&nbsp;<strong>Stormi</strong>, 5. In the post titled, “recents,” Kylie added a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of Aire</a> in a plaid jacket and tan suede pants, during a dinner outing. The last slide was arguably the cutest, as she added a photo of her five-year-old daughter walking alongside her baby brother. Stormi rocked a white tank top and denim shorts while she walked outdoors with her younger sibling. Kylie welcomed both of her children with her on-and-off (currently off) beau,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>, 32.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While Kylie is the youngest of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>‘s daughters, she has always wanted to be a mother. She has even famously professed that she wanted to be a “young mom.” Aside from her passion for motherhood, Kylie recently sparked speculation that her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rumored romance</a> with actor <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong></a>, 27, is heating up after she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rocked a ring</a> on “that” finger on Jul. 13. The brunette beauty wowed in a white dress via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and sported a large ring on her left hand while she promoted a beverage brand. “summer glow @drinkglow #glowpartner,” she captioned the sexy photos. The two were first linked earlier this spring after they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted mingling</a> at Paris Fashion Week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BtZqSxnJ6ybrbEp6Weql2WtrOxjJymq6aipMS0ecinqq2Zl6eurnnPoaatp6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
