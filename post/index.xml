大好きな音楽をきっかけに出会い、人生に沢山の色をくれました。そして何よりも僕の音楽の可能性を信じ続けてくれている方です。

Official髭男dism
藤原 聡
藤原聡さんが結婚した相手は過去にライブで目撃されたことがあるそうです。
藤原聡の嫁がOfficial髭男dismのライブでファンに目撃される（彼女時代） 2019年のいい夫婦の日に入籍したヒゲダンの藤原聡さんですが、実は結婚する手前の彼女時代にライブでファンに目撃されていたのです。
「今日自分の席の両隣がギリギリまで空いてて右側には来たけど左は空いてた。右側に来た人メンバーの知人なんじゃないかな？終始座っているんだけどノってはいた。最後のMCではホロっと涙流してたようだった。」
「やっぱり武道館ライブの自分の隣の席のワンピースが素敵に似合ってた人は大ちゃんかさとっちゃんの奥さんだったんでは？と改めて思ってしまいました」
2019年の武道館ライブで隣に来たワンピースの女性が、今考えてみたら藤原聡さんの嫁さんだったのでは？という証言ですね。
ちなみに藤原聡さんの嫁さんでわかる情報は少ないです。
公式でわかるヒゲダン・藤原聡の嫁の情報 現在の時点で藤原聡さんは結婚してあまり月日が経っていないので、結婚生活や嫁さんに関する言及は結婚当時のコメントぐらいです。
結婚コメントから汲み取れる嫁さんの情報は、
音楽をキッカケに出会った。 藤原聡の人生にたくさんの色をくれた。 藤原聡の音楽の可能性を信じ続けてくれた 結婚したのは11月22日。 嫁との結婚はヒゲダンを支えてくれるファンに自分の言葉で伝えたかった。 との情報ぐらいでですね。
藤原聡の嫁はレコード会社で働く同年代の女性？子供は非公表の予感
ファンの間では藤原聡さんの嫁さんがレコード会社に勤める女性ではないのか？との噂があります。
結婚発表のコメントでは音楽を通じて知り合った女性だと仰っていたので、ファンか音楽関係者であると言われており、結婚後の長年のファンたちの反応を見てる限り、ファンは違う気がします。
基本的にレコード会社の人間が所属ミュージシャンに手を出すのは印象が悪いため、そこの組み合わせは結婚しても情報を隠されることが多いです。
ただの噂かもしれませんが、結婚当時に長年のファンが露骨に残念がっていたので、何か嫌な事情を察してたのでしょうね。
嫁との間に子供がいても公表はされない予感 現在の時点で藤原聡さんと嫁さんとの間に子供が生まれたような報道はありませんが、仮に生まれてたとしても非公表するに可能性があります。
RADWIMPSなど現在の若いバンドマンは私生活を非公表するにケースが多いです。というよりバレてから仕方なくラジオやライブのMCでさりげなく言及して発表したりしますね。
悪い予感が多い藤原聡の結婚。売れる前に支えた一般人の彼女とは不倫になりがち？ これまでの邦楽ロックの歴史を振り返ってみても、売れる前や売れ始めに出会った彼女と結婚するケースは失敗が多いです。
特にボーカリストは不倫や乗り換え、忙しさ故に新婚生活にひびが入るパターンが多いです。
藤原聡さんは名曲「Pretender」を生み出し、紅白に出場した時期ということで、そのやばいパターンの王道であります。
過去の先輩たちの失敗。ミスチル、GLAY、イエモン、BUCK-TICK・・などなど Official髭男dismのファンは若い子が多いので、バンドマンのボーカルの業界でのモテぶりをあまり存じてないことでしょう。
過去、売れる前か直前に出会った彼女と結婚し、不倫からの離婚に流れてきた先輩たちを振り返ってみましょう。
・TERU「GLAY」。売れない時代を支えた一般女性と1993年に結婚し、1998年にPUFFY亜美と共演し不倫。2000年に離婚。離婚した相手との娘が売れっ子YouTuber「こばりし。」。
・櫻井淳「BUCK-TICK」。バンドが売れ始めた1991年に一般女性とデキ婚し1年後に離婚。元嫁との子供は芥川賞を取った遠野遥。
・桜井和寿「Mr.Children」。1990年前半にマネージャーとして支えた一般女性と結婚し1994年に長女誕生。その後に合コンで知り合った元グラビアアイドルの吉野美佳と不倫し2000年に離婚。
・吉井和哉「THE YELLOW MONKEY」。メジャーデビュー直後の1992年に下積みを支えた一般女性と結婚。タレント真鍋かをりと不倫し2008年に離婚。元嫁との息子がモデルの吉井添。
清春は娘がバンドマンの彼氏を連れてきたら”全力で潰す”ぐらい嫌
上記で紹介した４人はあくまで一例で、実はもっといます。ボーカル以外を含めると凄まじい数います。
よくテレビ番組で娘がいるミュージシャンに「娘がバンドやってる彼氏連れてきたらどうする？」と意地悪な質問をする場面を見ると思います。
かつて「ダウンタウンなう」に出演された清春さんは「全力で潰す」と断言されていました。
それぐらい、ミュージシャンという職業は女性を幸せにするのに適さないということです。
