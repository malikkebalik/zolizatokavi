The song begins with a spoken introduction, describing a vision of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, with the first one riding on a white horse. The lyrics then focus on a man who is taking names and deciding who to free and who to blame. The song suggests that not everyone will be treated equally and there will be a hierarchy when the man comes around. The idea of a golden ladder represents the concept of reaching heaven or eternal life after death while the potter's ground is symbolic of being lost or forgotten.</p><br><p>Cash's lyrics are filled with biblical references such as Alpha and Omega's kingdom come and Armageddon. The suggestion is that the end times are near and that the final judgment is coming. There is a sense of impending doom and terror in the lyrics, as the trumpets and pipers play and multitudes march to the big kettle drum. The whirlwind in the thorn tree is symbolic of chaos and uncertainty, while the virgins trimming their wicks and the crowns being cast at the feet of the wise men suggest the end of life on earth.</p><br><p>The song is a powerful allegory that forces listeners to confront their own mortality and consider the consequences of their actions. It is a warning that the end is near and that judgment is coming. The chorus is a call to action, urging listeners to listen to the words long written down when the man comes around.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>And I heard as it were the noise of thunder</u><br>I heard a loud, powerful sound like that of thunder</p><br><p><u>One of the four beasts saying 'Come and see', and I saw</u><br>One of the four beasts invited me to observe, and I accepted</p><br><p><u>And behold a white horse</u><br>I saw a white horse</p><br><p><u>There's a man going around taking names</u><br>There is an individual who is collecting people's names</p><br><p><u>And he decides who to free and who to blame</u><br>He determines who deserves forgiveness and who deserves punishment</p><br><p><u>Everybody won't be treated all the same</u><br>Different people will receive different treatment</p><br><p><u>There'll be a golden ladder reaching down</u><br>There will be a path to reach a higher level of existence</p><br><p><u>When the man comes around</u><br>When the aforementioned individual arrives</p><br><p><u>The hairs on your arm will stand up</u><br>You will experience fear or unease</p><br><p><u>At the terror in each sip and in each sup</u><br>You will find fear in every aspect of life, even the most routine or mundane</p><br><p><u>Will you partake of that last offered cup</u><br>Will you take the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness</p><br><p><u>Or disappear into the potter's ground</u><br>Or will you face eternal damnation</p><br><p><u>Hear the trumpets hear the pipers</u><br>Listen to the sounds of trumpets and pipes</p><br><p><u>One hundred million angels singing</u><br>Hear the voices of a great multitude of holy beings</p><br><p><u>Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum</u><br>A crowd is traveling together to a great event</p><br><p><u>Voices calling, voices crying</u><br>Hear the sound of people calling out or weeping</p><br><p><u>Some are born and some are dying</u><br>Some people are being born while others are dying, representing the cycle of life and death</p><br><p><u>It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come</u><br>This marks the arrival of the beginning and the end of time</p><br><p><u>And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree</u><br>A great storm is approaching, and even the most sheltered places will be impacted</p><br><p><u>The virgins are all trimming their wicks</u><br>Young, pure individuals are preparing for the arrival of the promised savior</p><br><p><u>It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks</u><br>It is difficult to resist the inevitable</p><br><p><u>'Til Armageddon no shalom, no shalom</u><br>Until the end of the world, there can be no peace</p><br><p><u>Then the father hen will call his chickens home</u><br>After the apocalypse, the God of the Bible will reclaim his faithful followers</p><br><p><u>The wise men will bow down before the throne</u><br>Wise and knowledgeable leaders will show deference to the divine ruler</p><br><p><u>And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns</u><br>They will humbly give up their earthly power and authority to serve the divine ruler</p><br><p><u>Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still</u><br>Those who have acted unjustly will not be granted forgiveness</p><br><p><u>Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still</u><br>Those who have lived virtuously will continue to do so</p><br><p><u>Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still</u><br>Those who have acted immorally will remain so</p><br><p><u>Listen to the words long written down</u><br>Read and heed the wisdom of texts that have existed for centuries</p><br><p><u>In measured hundred weight and penny pound</u><br>In exacting and precise amounts</p><br><p><u>And I looked and behold, a pale horse</u><br>I saw a pale horse</p><br><p><u>And it's name it said on him was Death</u><br>This horse was called Death</p><br><p><u>And Hell followed with him.</u><br>After Death comes Hell, the place of eternal punishment</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © O/B/O APRA AMCOS</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIKfnbuvxb58mKygX4y1prq%2BjZ%2Bel32Wu6CPzqacrJdxp7y2usM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
