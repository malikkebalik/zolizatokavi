He plays for the <i>Brooklyn Nets</i> of the NBA as a Point Guard. The 28-year-old has been serving as vice president of the National Basketball Players Association since <i>February 2020</i>. Previously, Irving played for <i>Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics</i>, and college basketball for the <i>Duke Blue Devils</i>.</p><p>Kyrie Andrew Irving was born on <i>March 23, 1992</i>, in Melbourne, Australia.

Still, the news of their engagement is extremely low-profile. The couple has been <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>together</strong></a> since <i>December 2018</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/23/KyrieMarlene-1608718618009.jpg><p>In <i>September 2019</i>, Marlene was spotted with a beautiful engagement ring. Irving secretly proposed to her in an undisclosed location. However, it is not known if Kyrie and Marlene aka Golden will tie their knot anytime soon.</p><h3>Are Kyrie and Marlene still together?</h3><p>There haven't been any confirmations, but it seems things aren't going well between Irving and Wilkerson. The speculation of their split first appeared after Irving deleted all the posts dedicated to Marlene on his social media.

Irving doesn't make a public appearance with his daughter, unlike <a href=#><strong>Stephen Curry</strong></a> makes with his daughter, <a href=#><strong>Riley Curry</strong></a>.</p><h2>Kyrie Irving Past Relationships</h2><p>After separating from Andrea, Kyrie began a series of short-lived relationship with different women.

Later in 2018, Kyrie defended his ex by posting an apology via Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/23/IrvingKeh-1608719292751.jpg><p>Moreover, Irving has dated or has been linked up with <strong>Gabrielle Lexa</strong>, <strong>Chantel Jeffries</strong>, <strong>Natalia Garibotto</strong>, <strong>Callie Rivers</strong>, and <strong>Ashley Bishop</strong>.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The 6 feet 2-inch six-time All-Star, Kyrie Irving has a net worth of <strong>$90 million</strong> as per celebrity net worth.
