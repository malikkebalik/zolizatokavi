There are currently no specific details on how the story will unfold, so all we can do is speculate. There are spoilers below, so if you haven‚Äôt finished Season 5, stop reading now.</p><p>Season 5 concludes abruptly. There‚Äôs a sense that things were cut off with a 14-episode run rather than 22 (for the first two seasons), 20 (Season 3), and 16 (Season 4).</p><p>And that‚Äôs where we left Bravo Team: on the ground in Mali, under fire from RPGs in an ambush.</p><p>If SEAL Team wanted to go out in a blaze of glory, that would certainly be the end of the storyline, but the movie and Season 6 confirm that someone ‚Äì something ‚Äì survives.</p><p>With Clay Spenser announcing his intention to leave Bravo Team in order to spend more time with Stella and the baby, and Jason Hayes suffering from breacher‚Äôs syndrome, the door was already open for a change on Bravo Team.</p><p>Outside of the team, Hayes has recently taken steps to establish his relationship with Mandy Ellis, but no one who watches the show will be surprised if this does not happen ‚Äì the sub-plot of the entire SEAL Team has been about the pressure that affects personal relationships.</p><p>In reality, we have no idea where the show will go; all we know is that it is moving forward, and that SEAL Team will undoubtedly charlie mike.</p><h2><strong>SEAL Team Season 5 Review</strong></h2><p>Critics gave SEAL Team Season 5 high marks. The sixth season of SEAL Team appears to be receiving a warm reception from the audience.</p><p>We saw at the end of the fifth season of the show SEAL Team that Bravo will need all hands on deck for a big mission to shut down Venezuela‚Äôs nuclear programme, but the biggest threat to their success could be one of their own.</p><p>After that, Bravo must make a daring escape just as they are about to leave Venezuela, but they find themselves on even less stable ground when they return home to Virginia Beach. Let‚Äôs wait and see what happens next.</p><p>We anticipate that the sixth season of SEAL Team will pick up where the fifth season of SEAL Team left off. If we receive any new information about the story of the sixth season of SEAL Team, we will post it here.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Bling Empire Season 3 Possible Release Date, Plot And Everything You Need To Know in 2022</a></li><li><a href=#>Only Murders In The Building Season 2: Finally Get Release Date On Hulu!
