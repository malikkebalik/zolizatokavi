[But] he did more damage to Cosa Nostra being out there and putting it on Front Street than 10 cooperating witnesses put together,’’ Gravano said in a YouTube interview, apparently referring to the late Dapper Don’s flamboyant style and in-your-face approach to the feds.</p><p>Gravano’s chat with YouTube interviewer Patrick Bet-David appeared to be the first time he’s talked on camera in more than 20 years — since his sit-down with ABC-TV’s Diane Sawyer in 1997.</p><p>The ex-underboss — <a href=#>whose turncoat testimony</a> helped the feds finally nail the Gambino chief in 1992 — added of Gotti, “Most of the real gangsters believe that and know that.</p><p>“I’ve got 22 years in prisons. I’ve bumped into a lot of guys,” the chrome-domed rat insisted to Bet-David in the clip posted Friday.</p><p>“Bobby, he was the underboss in Boston. And he said, ‘Sammy, you wanna know the truth? I hear more crying and complaints about John than you, the position he put you in. And he betrayed you. When he betrayed you like that, that was a rat move,’ ” said the ex-Mafioso, seemingly referring to former Boston mob capo Robert “Bobby” DeLuca, <a href=#>who was sentenced to 66 months behind bars in 2018</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/gotti_gravano2.jpg><p>Gravano added of his former Gambino boss, “Your job as John Gotti is not to put me away so you can get out and I can take the weight — that’s a rat move.”</p><p>Gravano, an admitted mass murderer, turned rat in exchange for a sweetheart prison deal and eventually a life in witness protection. Meanwhile, Gotti was convicted of murder, extortion, racketeering and tax evasion in 1992 and died of throat cancer in prison in 2002 while serving a life sentence. Before his conviction, he also was known as the “Teflon Don’’ — because criminal charges never stuck to him.</p><p>Gravano then famously left the federal protection program in the mid-1990s, claiming it was too restrictive.</p><p>He ended up getting nabbed for running a massive ecstasy ring in 2001 and was charged in both Arizona and New York over it, landing concurrent 19-year and 20-year prison sentences.</p><p>He was <a href=#>released early&nbsp;in 2017</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7kGlma2lfqK6uudhmq6GdXZfCrbiMoKmarpGjvG6%2ByKmqZqWfl3qju9KsZKOnmKN6qLvTraBmoZ5is6q%2B0q1koqakmr%2B3tcSwZKKmXZmypK3Dnqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
