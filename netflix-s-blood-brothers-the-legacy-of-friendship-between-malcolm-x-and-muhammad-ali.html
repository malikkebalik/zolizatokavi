Ali’s younger brother, Rahman, and X’s daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz, are some of them.</p><p>The trailer features&nbsp;how faith and politics helped bring Malcolm X and Ali together. They were both passionate about Islamic conversion and the fight for Black freedom in America. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>Netflix</a>&nbsp;trailer includes footage of the duo giving quotes and speeches fervently. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Inspired by a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">book of the same name</a>, written by Randy Roberts and Johnny Smith, the documentary celebrates the friendship between the two, but it also chronicles the strained parts of their relationship and the fallout caused by their diverging beliefs about faith.&nbsp;</p><h2>Friendship and Faith</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>It is no secret that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ali and X were like family</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The two first met in 1962, when Ali was still Cassius Marcellus Clay. His friend, Sam Saxon, a Black Muslim, invited him and his brother and took them to a Savior’s Day rally in Chicago,&nbsp;an annual event hosted by the Nation of Islam.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Saxon knew Clay had been looking for spiritual guidance and introduced him to X, the public face of the Nation of Islam. As X spoke at the rally, Clay was mesmerized and it left a profound impression on him. X, too, was charmed by Clay’s enthusiasm and aura.&nbsp;</p><p>Their reciprocal intrigue led them to spend a lot of time together and cultivate a friendship. X, who was 16 years older than Clay, was like a father and a big brother. Clay had become fascinated with the Nation, while X knew Clay could bring in more followers for the Nation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The US government considered the Nation a threat, so Clay kept his faith to himself until he beat Sonny Liston, the reigning heavyweight champion. Then, several days after his victory, the boxer announced&nbsp;he was indeed a member of the Nation.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fallout and Regrets</h2><p>He changed his name&nbsp;from Cassius Clay to Cassius X&nbsp;to Muhammad Ali, chosen for him by the Nation of Islam’s leader, Elijah Muhammad. By this time, X had been removed from the Nation after a fallout with the leader.&nbsp;</p><p>X left the Nation and urged Ali to join him. But unfortunately, Ali was already a staunch believer in the Nation of Islam’s leader and the religion he’d founded. He saw X’s actions&nbsp;as an act of betrayal.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The blood brothers had a fallout, and after that, they only met once in Ghana, outside the Ambassador Hotel.</p><p>When X came to greet Ali, Ali turned him away, publicly announcing their fallout. A wanted man, X was assassinated early the following year.</p><p>Blood Brothers&nbsp;will feature never-before-seen archival footage that provides a timeline for their friendship and fallout.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It will be available to stream via Netflix on September 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqcpLylecGrpq2glafAbrnApZqopJ1ixW651KGYpqWRmXqiuMhnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
