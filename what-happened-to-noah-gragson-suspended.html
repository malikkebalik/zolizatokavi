He was suspended after like a contentious meme that ridiculed the tragic death of George Floyd, an event that ignited heated discussions on race all across the world.</p><p>Gragson was immediately suspended by Legacy Motor Club after they posted a statement on social media indicating that his actions were against the team’s principles. Gragson won’t be competing in the upcoming NASCAR Cup Series race at Michigan International Speedway as a result of the ban; Josh Berry will take his place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_he_got_suspended></span><strong>Why he got suspended?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After liking a social media meme that mocked George Floyd’s death, Noah Gragson was threatened with expulsion from Legacy Motor Club and NASCAR. The meme made fun of the terrible incident in 2020 when a white police officer knelt on a Black man’s neck for more than nine minutes, causing George Floyd to die.</p><p>The Legacy Motor Club team swiftly decided to suspend Gragson indefinitely because the post’s crudeness and offensiveness went against the principles they uphold.

The NASCAR Rule Book’s Member Conduct section and Legacy Motor Club’s ideals were both violated by Gragson’s love of the meme, which led to his ban from both organizations.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>Also, Read</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtor5iWwW60wKmnnqaVmXq1u4ynppqgXZy%2ForPSqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
