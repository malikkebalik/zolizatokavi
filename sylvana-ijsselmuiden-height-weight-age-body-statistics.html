After that, she participated in theater for many years in Leeuwarden and, contrary to people’s usual assumption that success came easily to her, she had experienced enough setbacks. She had overcome all obstacles and managed to achieve her goal.</li><li>In 2020, she was placed first in the FHM500, which made her the most beautiful woman in the Netherlands of 2020.</li><li>Sylvana has been known to be honest, one who has dared to dream and is hard-working by nature.</li><li>She has noticed others criticizing her and her appearance, both positively and negatively, which has at times been hard on her. She has believed in never judging someone on his or her looks. Nevertheless, she has learned to take harsh comments in her stride and has felt lucky to have a loving family and a good foundation. If she has sometimes been disappointed, she has stayed optimistic knowing that everything would be fine soon.</li><li>IJsselmuiden has revealed that after shifting to Utrecht, she has started to miss Leeuwarden so much that she has thought of moving back there. She has loved the atmosphere of Leeuwarden, the town, the mentality, and the fact that most of her family and friends have been there. Sylvana has observed how going from Leeuwarden to Amsterdam has taken five minutes, yet she has been on the road all day. She has been relieved when, after gaining more recognition, she has had the privilege to choose recording days herself.</li><li>Sylvana has admitted that after her stardom, she has not been able to walk quietly on the street, as people have recognized her and started taking pictures or approaching her. She has liked the attention, while at times, she has wished for a more normal life that has made her secretly quite happy when everyone including her had to wear mouth caps. Sylvana has put on a hood along with the mask and has enjoyed going out without getting spotted. She has, however, appreciated everybody who has followed her, as that has allowed her to experience her most-cherished profession. She has never refused to get photographed.</li><p>Featured Image by Sylvana IJsselmuiden / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqywpa6Ro65utcmsqp6knaq2pbHNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
