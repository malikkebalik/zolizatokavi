The singer has admitted to having lip fillers and cheek fillers. She shared that she gets collagen waves as well. While some troll Tulisa for her excessive plastic surgery, others praise the N-Dubz star for being so open about it.</strong></p><p><strong>Tulisa Contostavlos</strong> came to fame as a member of the R&B/hip hop group N-Dubz with her cousin <strong>Dappy</strong> and friend <strong>Fazer</strong>. The English <a href=#><strong>singer</strong></a>, as a part of the group, has two platinum-certified albums, two gold-certified albums, five MOBO awards, a Brit Award nomination, thirteen top 40 singles, six silver-certified singles, and three Urban Music Awards.</p><p>As for her solo career, she <a href=#><strong>judged the reality singing competition</strong></a> The X Factor UK from 2011 to 2012. She released her debut album The Female Boss in 2012. She also dipped into acting and <a href=#><strong>starred</strong></a> in the British horror film Demons Never Die and the comedy film Big Fat Gypsy Gangster in 2011. Currently, she's the subject of plastic surgery speculations.</p><p>Every public appearance she makes, people find it hard to recognize her because her facial features have changed so much because of the cosmetic procedures she has had that every conversation about her becomes about the cosmetic enhancements she has had. Let's talk about the N-Dubz star Tulisa's plastic surgery!</p><p>There are more <a href=#><strong>plastic surgery</strong></a> stories of <a href=#><strong>Deborra-Lee Furness</strong></a> and&nbsp; <a href=#><strong>Anna Wintour</strong></a> for you to check out.</p><h2>N-Dubz: Tulisa Contostavlos' Plastic Surgery; The Singer Has Admitted to Having Lip Fillers and More!</h2><p><strong>Tulisa Contostavlos</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@tulisacontostavlos</a>) from N-Dubz has been very open about her plastic surgery and has revealed that she has had <strong>lip</strong> <strong>fillers</strong> and<strong> cheek fillers</strong>. She has also admitted to doing anti-aging (<strong>Botox</strong>) and muscle-tightening treatments.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/tulisa-n-dubz-pic.jpg alt="Tulisa from N-Dubz looks unrecognizable because of the plastic surgery she has had.

The former X-factor judge had an interview on the ITV daytime show alongside her N-Dubz members <strong>Fazer </strong>and <strong>Dappy</strong>. But it was not what she said that the viewers focused on (they paid little attention to it), it was mostly how she looked that people focused on. They could not recognize her because as they said, she looked very different from back when she looked like a 'human.' You can see where I'm going with this - her plastic surgery speculations.</p><p>After viewers got over the initial shock that the person speaking on that episode of This Morning was Tulisa Contostavlos from N-Dubz, they began to comment on her appearance and speculate the plastic surgery she must have gone overboard with, to end up looking like that. One fan commented that she looked 'rubbery' and they could never have recognized her if they hadn't introduced her. Another remarked that she 'couldn't move her face.' There were many such comments like that.</p><p>Well, if you must know what plastic surgery Tulisa did to look like that, in her own words, she once hit back at those trolls shaming her for her cosmetic procedures in an interview when she said,</p><p><strong>I'm older too, so my face is going to change. I like to do anti-ageing and muscle tightening treatments, and I keep my lip fillers up.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/tulisa-n-dubz-pic2.jpg alt="Tulisa from N-Dubz admitted to having lip fillers and cheek fillers.

Well, she said <a href=# rel=noopener>anti-aging and muscle-tightening treatments</a> but they surely mean Botox and such other cosmetic procedures. She has never shied away from the fact that she has chosen to have cosmetic enhancements. She has been discussing the procedures she has been having ever since she started having them.</p><p>Remember how much uproar it caused when Tulisa <a href=# rel=noopener>admitted to having cosmetic surgery on her lips and cheeks</a> in 2014? That time was chaotic as h*ll because she did it at a time that her assault trial was going on. She was receiving flak for every little thing, even the ones that had nothing to do with the trial. But she didn't hesitate to own up to her plastic surgery procedures. In an interview with The Guardian, the N-Dubz star said,</p><p><strong>Yes, I’ve had my lips done, and I’m happy with my lips. And I also had a tiny bit of filler in my cheeks. Pictures of me where my face swelling, I had water retention – where you have filler your face draws up loads of water. So my face began to swell like a balloon.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/tulisa-n-dubz-pic3.jpg alt="Tulisa from N-Dubz denied getting a nose job.

Magazine</strong></p><p>Tulisa from N-Dubz also admitted to having facial boosters after dropping to 7 stone 11 pounds. She was also suspected of having a nose job but that she denied. She insisted that her sharply defined nose was due to makeup and contouring and that she had not had plastic surgery to make her nose slimmer like people said.</p><p>In 2019, when host<strong> Lorraine Kelly</strong> mocked her for her plastic surgery, calling her daft for doing 'silly things to her face' on her show, Tulisa didn't take the bait and said that she still got fillers in her lips aside from lots of other treatments. About her <a href=# rel=noopener>trouble with cosmetic surgery</a>, she said,</p><p><strong>I went through stages and I had an allergic reaction to something and it took me a long time to get rid of it. But I’m happy now, still having little bits of filler in my lips. I get lots of treatments… and do my collagen wave now and again. It’s all about maintaining… Inside and outside. Giving yourself a little spruce now and then, exercise comes into play. Keep you feeling good in here.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGirrqSZqK5uuoydrJuyXaW5or%2FToppmq6WntKa%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
