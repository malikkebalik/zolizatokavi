They can also be valued at tens of thousands of dollars. They’re Funko Pop figures and accumulating, trading, and selling them is no laughing matter.</p><p>The most costly Funko Pops can buy you a used car (and we’re not talking about a $500 clunker) or even a house. Maybe. I’ll get to that later.</p><p>We used Pop Price Guide, a popular, but not comprehensive, a pricing guide for all things Funko, to construct this list of Funko holy grails. The Pop Price Guide will occasionally list an item for less than what it is selling for on the market, and it does not always account for all sales. However, as an approximated average, it’s still a good way to check what Funko Pops are selling for.</p><p>However, as with any collection, its value might rise or fall depending on market conditions. Regardless, if you have any of these valuable, rare Funko Pops, listed from least to most costly, you can sell them for a lot of money to the proper bidder.</p><h2>The Top 15 Funko Pop Vinyls in Value</h2><p>The following list of Funko Pop Vinyls and figures was constructed using information from different websites, including Pop Price Guide.</p><p>The 15 most valued Funko Pop Vinyls are as follows:</p><h2><strong>1. Clockwork Orange Funko Chase</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Clockwork-Orange-Funko-Chase.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Price: $13,300</p><p>Clockwork Orange Funko is the most expensive Funko Pop.</p><p>The biggest difference between this and other variations of Alex DeLarge Clockwork Orange is that he isn’t holding his cane. It’s a minor distinction, yet it adds to the property’s rising worth.</p><p>Unlike the other Pops on the list, its estimated worth of $13,300 is rather accurate, as others have apparently sold on eBay for roughly that amount in the past two years.</p><p>So, if you come across one for a reasonable price, grab it because it’s only going to get more valuable!</p><h2>2. Jaime Lannister Freddy Funko (Bloody)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jaime-Lannister-Freddy-Funko.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Price: $9,310</p><p>You’ll enjoy this Funko Pop if you’re a fan of Game of Thrones.</p><p>It’s a “bloody” variation of Game of Thrones Jaime Lannister that was only available during the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con.</p><p>The Pop is presently valued at $9,310; but, previous eBay listings have sold for $13,500, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see one sell for more than $20,000.</p><h2>3. Dumbo (Clown)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/dumbo-clown-funko-pop.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Price: $7,430</p><p>The Dumbo (Clown) Funko Pop Vinyl comes in third place.</p><p>It’s based on a sequence from Disney’s 1941 film “Dumbo,” in which an elephant is forced to participate in a circus while wearing clown makeup.</p><p>At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, the Pop was unveiled. It’s worth an estimated $7,430 based on recent transactions, and it’s certainly not something you’ll see every day.</p><h2>4. Stan Lee Signed Pops (Metallic)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boo-Berry-Funko.jpeg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Price: $6,100</p><p>If you have the money, this is possibly one of the bigger deals on the list.</p><p>Stan Lee’s “signature” on anything has most certainly increased in value since his death in 2018, and Funko Pops are no exception.</p><p>On eBay, a set of gold and chrome metal Stan Lee Pops was posted for an astounding $100,000 and has failed to sell.</p><p>Similar Pops, on the other hand, have been known for selling for $6,100.</p><h2>5. Frankenberry Freddy Funko (GITD)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Frankenberry-Freddy-Funko-GITD.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Price: $5,610</p><p>Funko wanted to have some more fun with their character and created the Frankenberry Freddy Funko (GITD).</p><p>Frankenberry was first launched during the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con and has since risen in value from $725 to $5,610.</p><p>The Frankenberry Pop is distinctive and well-loved among the Funko community, and most collectors want to grab all of the numerous varieties of the company’s mascot. It’s no wonder that this Funko has been able to achieve these astounding numbers.</p><h2>6. Buzz Lightyear Freddy Funko (GITD)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Frankenberry-Freddy-Funko.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The price is $5,030.</p><p>The Buzz Lightyear Freddy Funko (GITD) is ranked sixth, with an estimated price of $5,030.</p><p>This Funko Pop was based on the loving astronaut from the Toy Story films and was launched only at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con.</p><p>Buzz Lightyear Freddy Funko (GITD) Pops have sold for up to $6,500 since their release, while the average price is around $5,030.</p><p>If the current trend continues, the Buzz Lightyear Freddy Funko (GITD) could break the $10,000 barrier!</p><h2>7. Dumbo (Gold)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/dumbo-funko-pop-gold.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Price: $4,180</p><p>With an estimated worth of $4,180, the Legacy edition of the Dumbo Funko Pop carries a hefty price tag.</p><p>Collectors are always on the watch for this Funko, which was launched at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con. It can be hard to find.</p><p>In 2014, you could get one for roughly $710; but, fast forward to 2020, and you’ll be looking at around $6,000!</p><p>That is, however, for a one-time purchase; the average remains around $4,180. But that only goes to show that the sky is the limit if people are ready to pay.</p><h2>8. Boba Fett Freddy Funko (Red Hair)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Boba-Fett-Freddy-Funko-Red-Hair.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Price: $3,990</p><p>The Boba Fett droids figurine from Freddy Funko is valuable for more than $510, which is the typical market price for droid toys.</p><p>Only 24&nbsp;of this Funko were created, and it was debuted in 2014 at the San Diego Comic-Con.</p><p>Their scarcity instantly enhanced their value, with the red-haired variant commanding the highest price.</p><p>Boba Fett is a fictional character. The thirteenth-highest expensive Funko Pop vinyl is Freddy Funko.</p><h2>9. Count Chocula Freddy Funko (Metallic)</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Frankenberry-Freddy-Funko-Metallic.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The price is $3,780.</p><p>At the San Diego Comic-Con in 2011, an exclusive edition of the Count Chocula Freddy Funko (Metallic).</p><p>The Pop is part of the Pop! Ad Icons range and is based on General Mills’ monster-themed breakfast cereal “Count Chocula.”</p><p>Only 480 units were made, and the value of this little guy has slowly risen over the years, from $725 in 2014 on eBay to $3,780 now.</p><h2>10.
