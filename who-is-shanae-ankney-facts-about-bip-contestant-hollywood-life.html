Viewers will just have to tune in to see whether Shanae’s previous antics are back in Paradise. Ahead of the episode, learn more about Shanae below!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shanae-ankney-bachelor-in-paradise-5-things-embed1.jpg><h2>1. What Happened To Shanae On ‘The Bachelor’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Shanae was a contestant on&nbsp;<strong>Clayton Echard’s</strong> season of&nbsp;The Bachelor earlier this year. From the get-go, many of the other girls were skeptical about her. At first, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Shanae went after</a>&nbsp;<strong>Elizabeth Corrigan</strong>, who Clayton soon eliminated. Shanae faced major backlash for her comments that mocked Elizabeth’s ADHD, and Clayton later apologized for not realizing what was really happening when he wasn’t around. At the time, Clayton felt a connection with Shanae, and continued to keep her on the show, despite warnings from the other women.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Genevieve was Shanae’s next target, and the ladies were embroiled in a feud throughout the season. On one group date, Genevieve was part of the group that got to attend the after-party, while Shanae was not. So, Shanae took it upon herself to crash and stir up major trouble. Still, Clayton didn’t eliminate her. However, he did <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>send her home</a> during a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two-on-one date</a> with Genevieve during week five.</p><h2>2. What Does Shanae Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ahead of her time on The Bachelor, Shanae was working as a recruiter in Ohio. She was the Director of Recruiting at OPOC.us, previously working as a Relationship Analyst at the company. She has been with the company since July 2015. OPOC.us is a personalized service delivery firm for mid-sized organizations. Before that, Shanae worked as an administrative assistant to a neurosurgeon at Ohio State University. She held the position for nine months in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shanae-ankney-bachelor-in-paradise-5-things-embed2.jpg><h2>3. Shanae Was Baptized In 2021</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>In November 2021, Shanae shared a photo of herself getting baptized. “Such a special day for me,” she wrote. “One of the best days of my life.” Faith seems to be very important to Shanae, and she even describes herself as “faithful, patient and lovable” in her ABC bio</p><h2>4. Shanae Is A Licensed Cosmetologist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In addition to her work with OPOC.us, Shanae is also a licensed cosmetologist. She does not promote her beautician work much, but her LinkedIn page references the license.</p><h2>5. Shanae Dates Multiple Men In Paradise</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Before season 8 of&nbsp;BIP premiered, Shanae teased that she’ll be juggling men on the show, which was also shown in previews. “I’m not good with juggling one guy, so with multiple, it was hard,” she admitted. However, she also shared that she doesn’t have much drama with the other women this season, unlike her time on&nbsp;The Bachelor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LAqa3NmpxmmZ6gu6bFjK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqWZsZmeFdYSSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
