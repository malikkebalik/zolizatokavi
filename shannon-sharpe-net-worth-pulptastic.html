His parents divorced when he was just three months old, and he was raised by his grandmother in Glennville, Georgia along with his brother and sister. Sharpe attended Savannah State University, where he played basketball, football, and competed in track and field. He was a three-time All-Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference selection from 1987 to 1989, and in 1989, he was selected as a Kodak Division II All-American.

He was eventually drafted in the seventh round by the Denver Broncos, where he struggled as a receiver for two seasons. However, when he was switched to tight end, his performance drastically improved, leading to two championship rings with the Broncos and another with the Baltimore Ravens. Sharpe was selected to the All-Pro Team four times and played in eight Pro Bowls. He finished his career with 815 receptions, 10,060 yards, and 62 touchdowns, all NFL records for a tight end.</p><h2><span id=Shannon_Sharpes_Broadcasting_and_Media_Career>Shannon Sharpe’s Broadcasting and Media Career</span></h2><p>Following retirement, Sharpe became a commentator for “The NFL Today” on CBS Sports. He cohosted alongside James Brown, Bill Cowher, Boomer Esiason, and Dan Marino, replacing Deion Sanders. Critics decried his poor grammar and elocution. In 2014, he and Marino were replaced by Tony Gonzalez and Bart Scott.</p><p>Sharpe was a columnist and spokesperson for FitnessRX For Me magazine, appearing on its cover in 2013. He cohosts the sports debate show “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed” on Fox Sports 1 with Skip Bayless. He also cohosts Sirius NFL Radio’s “Opening Drive” morning program with Bob Papa and has his own podcast called “Shay Shay.”</p><h2></h2><p>In 2009, Shannon Sharpe was among 17 finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame but was not inducted. However, he was honored that year by being inducted into the NCAA Division II Football Hall of Fame, and his college jersey was retired. The following year, he was once again nominated for the Pro Football Hall of Fame and was successfully inducted in February of 2011 alongside other notable players like Jerome Bettis, Deion Sanders, and Art Modell.</p><h2><span id=Shannon_Sharpes_Personal_Life>Shannon Sharpe’s Personal Life</span></h2><p>In 2017, Sharpe dated fashion model Nicole Murphy.
