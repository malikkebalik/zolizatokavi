And when they finally welcomed the new arrival, they were all in for spoiling the little boy.</p><h2>How Candice Bergen Prepared for Daughter's Child</h2><p>Candice was already 74 when her daughter first became pregnant. She never pushed the idea of having children on Chloe. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I know better than to have suggested it to her," she said of the <a href=# rel=follow>pregnancy</a>. But when Chloe was finally expecting, she was "over-the-moon excited" about the prospect of having a grandchild. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I've been very discreet, but I'm just thrilled for her," she said of <a href=# rel="follow noopener">her feelings</a> regarding the blessing Chloe was about to receive.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The excitement Candice and her family had finally culminated in happiness on May 19, 2020. A COVID baby, Arthur Louis Albert&nbsp;was born after an easy and healthy pregnancy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Chloe had her son with her husband, Graham Albert.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Soon after his arrival, an insider source gave insight into Candice's happiness.</p><p>"Candice is exuberant," the source told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Closer magazine</a> at the time. "She's thrilled to embrace this new chapter in her life. It's pure love." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And as soon as he was born, the first-time grandmother&nbsp;got into spoiling the little guy, in good ways, of course.</p><p>"She has gone over the top!" the same insider source told the publication. However, her methods of spoiling were familiar.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Because Candice loves books so much, she got her grandson sets of classic books. There were so many of them; she could read those to him until he was five. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And there's fashion, of course. She also ordered enough clothes for the little man to be well-dressed all the time.</p><p></p><p><strong>Candice Bergen's&nbsp;grandson with the same toy car her daughter, Chloe Malle, played with when she was two.</strong> (Photo: Candice Bergen/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>One thing he got that wasn't new was his ride. He was handed down the same yellow and red car Chloe played with when&nbsp;she was two.</p><h2>Candice Bergen's Relationship with Daughter Chloe Malle</h2><p>Candice didn't have the best relationships with her parents, especially with her father. So, she made sure to maintain a good bond with Chloe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She has always been an "affectionate, doting and loving" mother to Chloe, and they stayed together&nbsp;as they lost her father and Candice's late&nbsp;partner, Louis Malle.</p><p>The love Arthur gets from Candice is just an extension of the love she has for Chloe. And she was sure Chloe would make an exceptional mother. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"All I can wish her is the overwhelming, infinite joy being her mama gave me. She is the love of my life," said Candice of her hopes for Chloe's new chapter in life with Arthur.</p><p>Candice and Chloe are a close, well-bonded mother-daughter duo. And even though their love for the little man was bound to bring them even closer, Candice still knew&nbsp;where the line&nbsp;in the sand was.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"She'll be there for her when Chloe asks, but she won't meddle or tell Chloe what to do," the insider told Closer at the time of Arthur's birth.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But even with the distance, she still made sure Chloe knew she was always there for her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Chloe and Arthur are both a regular fixture on Candice's Instagram posts. And Arthur, who turned one on May 19, 2021,&nbsp;looks great in each of his pictures.</p><p>Maybe Candice still curates her grandson's wardrobe. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRo7Gqr8RmmZ6ql5q7brDArp6hrJWne6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
