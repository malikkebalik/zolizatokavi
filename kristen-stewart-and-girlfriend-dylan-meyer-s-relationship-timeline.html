We're marrying, it's happening," the <a href=# rel=follow>Spencer</a> actress gushed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It has been a long-time coming, though.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The two first met each other in a movie set many years ago and later reconnected at a mutual friend's birthday party. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But it wasn't until the summer of 2019 that their dating rumors started. And things moved fast after that.</p><p>Stewart was ready to propose to her then-girlfriend in November that same year.</p><p>Fast forward to July 2021, and the couple's public sighting sparked secret marriage rumors. They were obviously not true. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple doesn't get pictured in public that often, and Meyer isn't a big celebrity, either. So, who exactly is Stewart's fiancée?</p><p>Dylan Meyer is a screenwriter by profession. Stewart has talked about how she has co-starred with her in a couple of movies — movies she refrained from naming.</p><p>She is a cat person. Other than containing appreciative posts about Stewart, her Instagram is filled with uploads about her feline companions.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She also is Stewart's outlet for messages she wants to relay on the internet.</p><p>The Twilight actress has used Meyer's Instagram on several occasions to share her thoughts on important issues, like imploring everyone to vote in the 2020 US Presidential elections.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Stewart's Dating History and Hard Path to Openness</h2><p>Stewart wasn't always this open about her personal relationships. She has admitted to being closed off about her dating life in the past.</p><p>"I didn't like giving myself to the public, in a way. It felt like such thievery. This was a period of time when I was sort of cagey," Steward <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confessed about her love life</a> in the past to Clea Duvall in October 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She has been in relationships with both men and women in the past.</p><p>But, whether it was in her relationship with her ex-boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Robert Pattinson</a> (2009-2013), or former girlfriend, Stella Maxwell (2017), she always attempted to keep them hush-hush.</p><p>She was afraid of the things she did with her partners becoming everyone else's business.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Similar was her approach to being a representative for&nbsp;the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>She didn't understand the pressure of the responsibility. Not because she didn't want anyone to know she was gay, but because the responsibility was huge.</p><p>Now, she relishes it. "I love the idea that anything I do with ease rubs off on somebody who is struggling," she told Duvall. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOinsC1sc1mqq2dp5a%2FtXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjJ6loJmXmrFvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
