Since the beginning of Gotti’s career he has already released several albums – “From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Ga,e”, “Self-Explanatory”, “Life”, “Back 2 da Basics”, “Live from the Kitchen” and “I Am”. Nowadays Yo Gotti is considered to be one of the richest rappers in United States, and furthermore, he is also one of the most influential personalities in the world of entertainment and show business.</p><h3>Yo Gotti Net Worth $1.5 Million</h3><p>Yo Gotti was born in1981, on May 19, in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. He was raised by his parents in Frayser and became interested in hip hop culture at 14 years of age. Then he had a nickname Lil Yo. He released his debut album in 2000, and it was called “From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game”, however, it was not really successful, even if it brought some amount of net worth to Yo Gotti. Trying to be more famous and build up net worth more seriously, Gotti released another album, “Self-Explanatory”, only one year later. However, it did not gain a place on US Billboard 200 chart, and the popularity of Yo Gotti was still not as big as he could expect after releasing two studio albums and investing money into his management.</p><p>Talking about Gotti’s net worth, we should also mention that the best answer to the question about how rich is Yo Gotti, is to note that he is a big fan of great cars. For example, we can imagine how huge is Gotti’s net worth since he owns an amazing Bentley Continental GTC, equipped not only with prestigious aluminium wheels, but also with matrix radiator and an exclusive rear.</p><p>Another auto owned by Yo Gotti is a Rolls Royce. When asked about why Yo Gotti bought this car, he answered that about the time when he purchased this vehicle everyone was driving black autos and it was considered to be extremely fashionable and popular. And this was also the reason why Yo Gotti decided to spend part of his net worth on buying a white Rolls Royce – to be different. Moreover, he also owns a Butlass, which is known to be worth more than 100,000 dollars and equipped with a 540 chrome block engine.</p><p>Of course, the real popularity came to Yo Gotti after he released an album entitled “I Am”. This album contains many guest appearances – <a href=#>Meek Mill</a>, YG, <a href=#>T.I.</a>, Rich Home Quan and <a href=#>Jeezy</a>, and this is one more reason why “I Am” was able to climb to number 7 on the US Billboard 200 and also the reason why Gottis’ net worth also increased immediately. It is already know that Gotti is planning to release a new album in year 2014, titled “The Art of Hustle”.</p><p>So now you can better imagine how big is net worth estimated by Yo.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.666666666667><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Yo Gotti</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 19, 1981</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Memphis, Tennessee, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Singer-songwriter, Rapper, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Southwest Tennessee Community College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Lakeisha Mims</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Mario Mims , Lil Yo</td></tr><tr readability=0.41025641025641><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/yogotti</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/yogottikom</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/yogottikom</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/yogotti</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3991140/</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nominations</td><td>World Music Award for World’s Best Album, BET Hip Hop Award for Best Album of the Year, World Music Award for World’s Best Live Act, World Music Award for World’s Best Male Artist, Weatherman, I Know, 81</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Video Girl</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=4><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=8><td>1</td><td>[on playing the historic Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, 2013] I booked the theater myself because it was my birthday and I do something big in the city every time.
