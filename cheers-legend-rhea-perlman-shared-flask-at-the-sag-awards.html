Perlman and Lisa Ann Walter from Abbott Elementary arrived ready for the annual awards show, sharing a flask during the opening monologue.</p><p>The SAG Awards usually don’t feature a host, but Idris Elba took the stage to announce that the show was streaming live on Netflix, meaning there wouldn’t be any commercial breaks. This prompted attendees to plan their bar visits with precision. “For those of you who were smart to bring a flask, remember: sharing is caring,” Elba joked.</p><p>The camera quickly focused on Rhea Perlman and Lisa Ann Walter in the SAG Award audience. Perlman took a sip from a silver flask, then handed it to Walter who accepted it with a smile. She then turned to her co-star Sheryl Lee Ralph. Of course, the famously buttoned-up Ralph demurely declined the beverage. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Footage</a> of the hilarious exchange made its way to X (formerly Twitter).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-both-rhea-perlman-and-lisa-ann-walter-were-up-for-sag-awards-this-year>Both Rhea Perlman and Lisa Ann Walter Were Up For SAG Awards This Year</h2><p>Perlman and Walter both received SAG nominations this year. Perlman is nominated with her fellow Barbie cast members for Outstanding Performance in a Motion Picture. On the other hand, Walter was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series for Abbott Elementary following her previous win in the same category last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rhea Perlman also scored big with a memorable appearance at the Emmy Awards last month. The cast of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheers</a> reunited at the iconic bar for a fun gathering. Perlman joined Ted Danson, Kelsey Grammer, John Ratzenberger, and George Wendt came together for a brief sketch.</p><p>“Ted, don’t you just think about it as a long overdue class reunion, huh?” Ratzenberger quipped. “Being together brings back some great memories from (the) show we’re all very proud of.”</p><p>Perlman requested an envelope to announce an Emmy award. Wendt appeared on stage with the envelope, presenting it for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. Christopher Storer of The Bear claimed this award, also winning an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"></figure><p>Other TV shows like Martin, Ally McBeal, The Sopranos, Grey’s Anatomy, and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia contributed to the reunion vibe. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler reunited for a Weekend Update segment from Saturday Night Live. The audience enjoyed seeing these familiar faces gain new attention. Before the show, Anderson discussed the reunion tributes featured at the Emmy Awards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51kvaa7z6WcaJuYmrKzv4ylnKCdnpl6s7TEmmSpnaKhuqK6jKyfmqqVmXqiecWlmKyjXay2tbSMn5ylpJ%2BseqLA056lnZ2VqHqiwIytn55lo5a0bq3Wmqmdq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
