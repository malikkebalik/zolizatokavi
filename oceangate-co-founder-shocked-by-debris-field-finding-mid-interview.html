Later, in 2021, he <a href=#>compared himself with Gen. Douglas MacArthur</a>, admitting that “I’ve broken some rules to make this [the Titan].”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stockton Rush has been slammed for skirting safety regulations with the Titan. <span class=credit>CBS</span></figure><p>“I think I’ve broken them with logic and good engineering behind me,” he boasted.</p><p>On Thursday, Söhnlein defended Rush to the BBC.</p><p>“[The] human submersible community globally is very small,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Titan is believed to have imploded mid-dive. <span class=credit>Becky Kagan Schott / OceanGate Expeditions</span></figure><p>“Developing innovations and any new technology, including submersibles, means that sometimes you have to go outside of the balance of the regulatory scheme,” he argued.</p><p>“But the bottom line is that everyone’s got different opinions on how subs should be designed, how dives should be conducted, how expeditions should be conducted.”</p><p>Söhnlein admitted, however, that the niche industry’s obsession with innovation can lead to blind spots.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Five people were killed instantly when the Titan imploded, officials have said. <span class=credit>Dirty Dozen Productions/OceanGat/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“The challenge, though, is with all of us having opinions is none of us have all the facts. So it’s difficult to form these opinions,” he explained.</p><p>Söhnlein also asserted his unflagging admiration of Rush, saying he’s “probably one of the most intelligent people [he has] met.”</p><p>“The biggest thing I’ve always admired about [Rush] is his healthy respect for risk, and his healthy respect for the dangers of the deep ocean,” he added. “Everything that we did was always very much focused on managing those risks.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stockton Rush had a “healthy respect for risk,” his co-founder said. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Rush seemed to dismiss the risks of the Titan sub journey in 2018, when members of the Marine Technology Society warned OceanGate that the vessel’s design <a href=#>could lead to “catastrophic” results</a>.</p><p>MTS member Brian Kemper maintains Rush launched the submersible in international waters to avoid industry regulations.</p><p>OceanGate’s former director of marine operations, David Lochridge, also claims he was fired for alerting Rush of concerns he had about the vessel’s lack of safety testing.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The last image of the Titan submersible in the Atlantic ocean on Sunday, June 18, 2023. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>In a now-viral 2022 CBS interview, Rush revealed the entire vessel was run by a modified video game controller — and brushed aside the dangers of deep-sea dives as trivial concerns.</p><p>“You know, at some point, safety just is a pure waste. I mean, if you just want to be safe, don’t get out of bed,” Rush told interviewer David Pogue.&nbsp;</p><p>“At some point, you’re going to take some risk, and it really is a risk/reward question. I think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rear Adm.

I could tell who they were because they’re all literally wearing jackets that say ‘Titanic’ on them. Everyone was wearing that blue OceanGate Titanic jacket,” John Law said of the eerie gathering.</p><p>In addition to Rush, billionaire explorer Hamish Harding, 58, French Titanic diver Pierre-Henri Nargeolet, 77, and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, and his son Sulaiman, 19, were aboard the Titan when it imploded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma2tfpLCmrc2gmK2dXZi8p7vUp5ueql2otbCvyp6bZpqpYrGmrtGiqmaemZq5pXnFoqWdoZ6ceq61w2agp6yVp8OqsdZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
