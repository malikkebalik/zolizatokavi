Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>According to sources, her <strong>net worth</strong> as of 2022 is estimated to be approximately $1 million, earned mostly through her nearly three-decade-long career in broadcast meteorology. However, it is certain that the successful sales of her novels also contributed to her fortune.</p><h2><span id=Belinda_Jensen-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Belinda Jensen- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Belinda Jensen was born in 1969 in Prescott, Wisconsin, USA, and she is of white ethnicity as well as American nationality. Further information, such as her exact birth date and information about her family’s background and parents, have never been made public. She did, however, grow up with four siblings, which has been accepted.</p><p>Jensen’s educational background is as follows: after graduating from a local high school, she enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in meteorology. She then got a Master’s degree in atmospheric science from the same university and continued her education at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Belinda has also received the American Meteorological Society’s Seal of Approval for meteorology broadcasting.</p><h2><span id=Belinda_Jensen-_Relationship_Married_Life>Belinda Jensen- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>She is a married woman with a husband named David, with whom she has two children – a son named Tanner born in 2003 and a daughter named Tori born in 2007. Despite her celebrity, she has managed to keep her personal life private and away from the public, as there aren’t many pertinent details available. She lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with her family and their pet dog, Bernese Mt. Dog.</p><p>During the early 2000s, there were allegations that Belinda was romantically involved with her fellow co-host of “Grow with KARE,” Bobby Jensen, but these were never substantiated and were ultimately proven to be incorrect.</p><h2><span id=Belinda_Jensen-_Professional_Career>Belinda Jensen- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Belinda began her career as a member of ABC’s affiliated channel KTVX in Salt Lake City, where she polished her professional talents over the course of three years, principally as its mapmaker, after completing her studies and earning a high degree of knowledge in meteorology. She began her career at KARE 11 in the early 1990s, largely as a weekend meteorologist covering exclusively local events.</p><p>The real breakthrough in her career came in 1993 when she went on to explain the details and scientific background for such historic rainfall for about 13 minutes while reporting from the field in the mid-western area of the United States, stuck in ‘flooding rain’ and lacking ‘proper instructions in her ear.’ She was later promoted as a result of her noteworthy report.</p><p>Belinda Jensen has been the head meteorologist for KARE 11 since 2005. She has expanded her professional portfolio by co-hosting numerous additional KARE 11 broadcasts, including a gardening show called “Grow with KARE,” which she co-hosts with Bobby Jensen, and she also appears on and co-hosts its weekend show “KARE 11 Saturday.”</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Belinda, 49, has a slim build, standing <strong>5ft 6ins (1.68m)</strong> tall and <strong>weighing</strong> roughly 130lbs (59kg). All of these ‘beauty benefits,’ in addition to her blue eyes and blonde hair, make her look appealing and camera-friendly.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Aside from appearing on-screen on a daily basis, fans can gain insight into her daily life by visiting her profiles on popular social media networks, as she is active on Facebook, where she has over 55,000 followers, Instagram, where her official account has nearly 8,000 followers, and Twitter, where her profile @BelindaKARE11 has 32,000 followers.</p><p>In addition to her successful and wealthy professional broadcasting career, she is passionate about passing on her meteorology expertise to others and can frequently be seen visiting classrooms, discussing ‘her passion and enthusiasm for weather-related issues’ with children and students. Belinda Jensen invented Bel the Weather Girl, the title character of an eponymous children’s book series, to help a wider audience learn meteorology and weather. So far, it has six releases: “Weather Clues in the Sky: Clouds,” “Spinning Wind and Water: Hurricanes,” “A Snowstorm Shows Off: Blizzards,” “Raindrops on a Roller Coaster: Hail,” “A Party for Clouds: Thunderstorms,” and “The Sky Stirs Up Trouble: Tornadoes.”</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Chloepowell</a>, <a href=#>Incinders</a>, and <a href=#>Soupachu</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>journalist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jovita Moore- Net Worth, Bio, Marriage, Height, Career</a></h3>The well-known American news anchor, journalist, and media personality Jovita Moore was born on October 4, 1968.
