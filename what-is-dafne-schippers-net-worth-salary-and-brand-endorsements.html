With remarkable achievements in sprinting and combined events, Schippers has left a huge impact in the sport. She has etched her name in history as the holder of the European record for the 200 meters, clocking in at 21.63 seconds. This feat positioned her as the sixth fastest woman ever in the event. In addition, she has registered Dutch records in the 100 meters, long jump, and co-holds the records for 60 meters indoor and 4×100 meters relay. She earned her the title of European Athlete of the Year consecutively in 2014 and 2015.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Born in Utrecht in 1992, Schippers’ passion for athletics began at a very early age. By nine, she was already showcasing her talent at Hellas, a renowned track and field club in her hometown. Her progress was evident when she bagged gold in the 100m and bronze in long jump during the European U23 Championships in 2013. That same year, at the World Athletics Championships that took place in Moscow, she clinched the bronze medal in heptathlon, and overtook notable competitors like Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Claudia Rath.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The next European Championships in 2014 saw her move even higher as she grabbed golds in both the 100m and 200m. With the world watching, debates stirred about her potential and whether sprinting or heptathlon would be her main event. By mid-2015, Schippers cleared the doubt through a tweet and expressed her intent to prioritize sprinting, especially leading to the World Athletics Championships 2015 and the Rio Olympics 2016. This paid off when she prevailed in the 60m during the European Indoor Championships and later shone at the Beijing World Athletics Championships, claiming silver in the 100m and a record-setting gold in the 200m.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, the Rio Olympics 2016 brought mixed outcomes. Many anticipated her to replicate the legendary Fanny Blankers-Koen’s feat who dominated the sprint event during the 1948 Olympics. However, she secured fifth in the 100m and bagged a silver in the 200m, trailing Elaine Thompson. Post-Rio, sensing the need for change, she partnered with U.S. coaching maestro, Rana Reider. But their collaboration, despite resulting in a world title defense in 200m, saw challenges as Schippers’ race form seemed off and the athlete lacked her signature acceleration. By late 2018, she renewed her partnership with her initial mentor, Bart Bennema.</p><h2 id=h-dafne-schippers-net-worth><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Dafne Schippers’ Net Worth</h2><p>The Net Worth of prominent Netherlands track and field athlete Dafne Schippers is estimated to be over $5 millions dollars.
