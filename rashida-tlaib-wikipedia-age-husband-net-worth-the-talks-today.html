The other Rep was Cori Bush. In the wake of a surprise Hamas strike that left hundreds dead, they referred to Israel as an apartheid state and demanded that the United States stop funding the country. Rashida Tlaib’s Wikipedia details, her age, husband, and net worth have all become topical issues since that incident.</p><p>Rashida Tlaib said she continues to “grieve the Palestinian and Israeli lives lost yesterday, today, and every day,” before calling for “dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance.”</p><p>In a floor speech in July, she rejected a House resolution in favor of <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Israel</a></strong> and has previously lambasted the Israeli government. In her lengthy statement, Tlaib—who is of Palestinian descent—also demanded that the siege on the Gaza Strip be lifted and that “the occupation” be put to an end.</p><p>“The failure to recognize the violent reality of living under siege, occupation, and apartheid makes no one safer. No person, no child anywhere should have to suffer or live in fear of violence. We cannot ignore the humanity in each other,” she said.</p><p>“As long as our country provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid government, this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue,” she continued.</p><p>This is why she has been in the news; thus, people want to learn more about her.
