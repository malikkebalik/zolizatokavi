Born to proud parents John D Abston, Sr, and Shirley Ann Watson Abston, Jon’s journey through life unfolded with a spirit that left an indelible mark on those who knew him. Tragically, on April 27, 2023, Jon bid farewell to this world, leaving behind a legacy of memories that will be cherished by all who were fortunate enough to share in his life.</p><p>Jon’s academic journey took him through the halls of Moss Point High School, where he graduated in 1984, setting the stage for the adventures that awaited him. Following the call to serve, Jon joined the United States Navy, dedicating a part of his life to the noble cause of safeguarding his country. In reflecting on his life, we remember Jon not just as a military man, but as a brother, son, and friend.</p><p>His untimely departure brings forth a wave of sorrow, compounded by the loss of his maternal grandparents, Herman Watson, Sr, and Evelyn Maxwell Watson, and paternal grandparents, JD Abston, and Hazel Abston. He now reunites with his parents, John, and Shirley Abston, leaving behind a void in the hearts of those who held him dear. Jon’s legacy extends beyond bloodlines.</p><p>It encompasses the bonds he forged with five siblings—two sisters, Bonnie (Thomas) Stewart of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Kenyotta (Tyrell) Mingo of Pascagoula, Mississippi, and three brothers, John Abston, Jr of Gulfport, Mississippi, Joseph Abston of Moss Point, Mississippi, and James (Chandra) Abston of Mobile, Alabama. His impact also touched the lives of two stepdaughters, Ayden Skye Crosby of Oceanside, California, and Jasmine Nicole Jones of Pascagoula, Mississippi.</p><p>A tapestry of aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends holds the threads of Jon’s memory. In this time of bereavement, the Abston family extends heartfelt gratitude for the outpouring of support, conveyed through phone calls, text messages, and condolences. Each expression of sympathy serves as a testament to the enduring impact of Jon’s presence in the lives of those he touched.</p><p>As we bid farewell to Jon Douglas Abston, we celebrate a life well-lived—a life that resonates in the stories shared, the laughter echoed, and the love woven into the fabric of countless hearts. May Jon’s spirit find eternal peace, and may his memory continue to bring solace to those who mourn his departure.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwts6hpWaZkqjBsLqMqJmirKWWv7p5zZ6uZqeiobKiutJmo6itmai2orrAZqGooJ5irqO%2F06ilZqCRqHqltcSdZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
