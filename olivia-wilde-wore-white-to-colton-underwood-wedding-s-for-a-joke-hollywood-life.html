Colton, 31, tied the knot with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jordan C. Brown</strong></a> at the Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa Valley, and Oliva revealed, via her Instagram Story, that she wore “a wedding dress to a wedding just so I could make a joke about it in my toast.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The dress in question was a backless Nili Lotan number, which featured spaghetti straps and a seductive dip down Olivia’s backside. She let her hair flow freely, while she protected her eyes with some chic sunglasses. While some might frown upon Olivia breaking with tradition – one should never wear white to a wedding unless you’re the one getting married – evidentially, both the outfit and the joke went over with the happy couple. “The Grooms approved,” Olivia captioned a shot of her embracing the newlyweds.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Colton and Jordan, 38, got married in front of 200 guests in an elegant outdoor ceremony. “One thing that’s really important to both of us is that we’ve created this, we’re calling it ‘our loving walk,'” Colton told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “It’s inspired [by] a coffee table book that I was gifted after I came out called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Loving</a>&nbsp;and it’s images of men in love throughout history. We blew them up and put them on canvases and set them around the resort. Next to them will be love letters from queer people in the 18th and 19th century that were forbidden, or they had to send in secret.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Olivia-Wilde-Backless-Wedding-Dress-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“We wanted to break some of the traditional norms of what a ceremony and a wedding look like,” he added. “And for the entire weekend, we recognize that a lot of people attending, both of our families and some of our friends, this will be their first queer wedding. We really want to make it special.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Olivia has been quite a fashionista, as of late. At the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Met Gala</a>, she wore a white dress inspired by the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chloé Spring 1983 Violin Dress</a> designed by the late <strong>Karl Lagerfeld</strong>. However, Vogue China editor <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Margaret Zhang</strong></a> wore a similar outfit, except hers was black. While some might be mortified to show up to the Met Gala in the same outfit, Olivia chalked it up to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“great minds” thinking alike</a>. “If you’re gonna twin with anyone, make it Margaret Zhang,” wrote Olivia on Instagram a day after.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5BuZqikmau2onnWoqOdnV2Zv6a%2F0maaqKSkpLtuwc2dnKuvn6SxbsPEnZuippdk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
