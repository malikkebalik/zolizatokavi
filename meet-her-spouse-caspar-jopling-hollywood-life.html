The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bride</a> wore an elegant white long-sleeved gown, while Caspar opted for a traditional black suit and grey trousers. More recently, on Aug. 31, 2021, the proud husband took to Instagram to gush over his wife of two years. “One year ago today we got on a little ferry to celebrate our first anniversary together.. 12 hours (and a negroni or two) later, we found out that there was going to be a new member of the jopsquad. What an anniversary that was !!”, his sweet caption of a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of her</a> read. “This anniversary, even with <strong>Arthur</strong> stealing so much of my heart , I love you even more than I did a year ago .. thanks a million for everything you do .. you’re pretty f**** grand :) xxx.”</p><h2>Ellie & Caspar’s Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Not too long after their 2019 wedding, Ellie and her spouse announced they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expecting</a> their first child, a son named Arthur, in Feb. 2021. She revealed the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> baby news</a> amid her interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue </a>that month. “We did the one show. I was pregnant and had no idea,” she told the outlet the same day they released photos of her growing baby bump. “It was crazy because it was our one-year anniversary. That was not the plan. The thought of getting pregnant didn’t seem like it could be a reality. Becoming pregnant kind of made me feel human. I want a better word than womanly, [but]—I have curves I’ve never had before. I’m enjoying it. My husband’s enjoying it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>By May 2, 2021, they were officially a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family-of-three</a>! Caspar took to his Instagram Story to share a photo of a bouquet of flowers to inform everyone that their little man <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had arrived</a>. “Mum and baby both healthy and happy,” he wrote at the time. “Extremely grateful. I don’t ever address the public attention that comes with Ellie’s job. But during this magical and personal moment we would really appreciate being able to enjoy our privacy .. Thank you x.” Most recently, on Dec. 7, 2021, he shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rare photo</a> of the happy family at the beach. “Miami Basel a bit different this year,” he captioned the adorable group shot.</p><h2>Who Else Has Ellie Dated?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Prior to her romance with Caspar, Ellie was linked to a few famous musicians and artists.
